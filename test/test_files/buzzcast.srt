1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
Alban: It is so stinking nice to
like, show up and record this

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,250
show. And Travis has already put
together an outline. Kevin's got

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,169
suggestions, I throw my thoughts
into the mix. And then Travis

4
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,739
goes and does all the work from
there, too. It's out into the

5
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:21,269
wild. And I don't see anything.
That's an absolute joy for at

6
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,730
least two thirds of the team.
Yeah, I mean, exactly.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,850
Kevin: You guys remember, like
two months ago, when you were

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,460
like, We're going all in on
video Buzzcast. I was like,

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,119
that's, I mean, I will agree and
commit and disagree, disagree

10
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,369
and commit, I'll do something.
But I don't want to do this.

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,240
Alban: I never said that. The
only reason we ever did video

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,619
was because of you.

13
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:53,249
Kevin: That is true. I will take
that. Because when we first got

14
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:55,978
locked down, and we weren't
allowed to see anybody in

15
00:00:55,978 --> 00:00:58,259
person, I was like, well, it
would be nice to be able to see

16
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,598
you guys when we record. And if
we're going to be doing video

17
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:04,049
chats Anyway, why don't we go
ahead and publish those. So I do

18
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,748
take the full blame for moving
us to video in the first place.

19
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:10,049
But how's that working out for
us?

20
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,079
Alban: Not good. The first one
we did was like a year ago, we

21
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,299
did that live stream to our
YouTube channel. And that just

22
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,140
kind of grew into then we wanted
to play around with Riverside,

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,829
which was doing video remote
video recording, and then squad

24
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,060
cast launched video, remote
video recording. And I think,

25
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,750
you know, we've you kind of had
the tools, the tools were there.

26
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,319
So we started playing with the
tools and experimenting. And now

27
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,459
the experiment is coming to an
end, at least for now, at least

28
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:49,379
for now. So do we want to give
like the whole story of it, kind

29
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,040
of walk through why we made each
decision along the way? And

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,859
let's give the sparknotes what
we learned the highlights

31
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,859
sparknotes? Yeah, start at the
beginning. Kevin, why did you

32
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:01,079
want to start doing some video
Buzzcast.

33
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,359
Kevin: When we first started
recording Buzzcast, we would do

34
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,260
it together in the office in our
little studio space. And we

35
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,879
could play off of each other's
energy, right? I think, Listen,

36
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,090
I'll speak for myself, I'm not a
super high energy person. So it

37
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,330
helps for me to be sitting
across the table for somebody or

38
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,000
to see somebody else's reactions
to what I'm saying or when

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,270
they're speaking themselves to
be able to keep myself amped up

40
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,789
and engaged in the conversation
when we went audio only and

41
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:29,729
there was no video component, it
was hard for me to continue to

42
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:32,669
keep my energy high. And to stay
engaged. I've also got a little

43
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:34,919
bit of add that I'm I'm fighting
and dealing with at the same

44
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,900
time. So that part was was
necessary in order to be able to

45
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:43,439
just produce good content. What
I was interested in is that

46
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,599
since we're doing this video
component Anyway, why don't we

47
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,210
record this, we've always said
that YouTube is an interesting

48
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,370
opportunity for people to
promote their podcasts because

49
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,139
they do have the algorithm, they
do have the recommendation

50
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,009
engine. But you shouldn't just
publish your audio only there.

51
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:58,409
Because that doesn't feed into
the strengths of the algorithm.

52
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:00,840
So you're not even getting the
benefit. And you're taking all

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,050
this extra time to do that. In
fact, you could be you know,

54
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,759
putting yourself at a
disadvantage if you do that,

55
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,189
because then you get a bad
reputation with the algorithm.

56
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,360
So anyway, we were doing video,
why not go ahead. And while we

57
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,699
edit the podcast, the audio
version, why not edit the video

58
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,620
version and just stick it on
YouTube and see if we get a bump

59
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,729
from it. That is where you guys
come in on the analytical side

60
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,870
and say, Is this working is this
not I will say that the

61
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,639
constraints from just somebody
who's on the podcast are much

62
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,340
higher than I anticipated. It's
one thing when you're out of the

63
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,250
office, or if you're traveling
or you can't be here there to be

64
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,430
able to quickly grab a USB mic,
throw it in your bag go with

65
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,409
you. And you can record audio
from anywhere in the world, it's

66
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:43,199
not too hard to find a quiet
space, most hotel rooms are

67
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,240
pretty quiet. Or if you're
staying on Airbnb or something

68
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,400
that you can find a closet, you
can find a quiet space to record

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,979
audio, being able to travel with
a decent camera setup. Or if you

70
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:54,479
don't have a decent camera
setup, then you're using

71
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,539
whatever on your laptop, you're
constantly worried about your

72
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,520
background, like all this stuff
is going on. It's just a

73
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,879
different level of commitment
and what's required in terms of

74
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,400
being able to put a show out
every week or every other week.

75
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:12,000
So that has been added an extra
level of commitment to the show,

76
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,069
which again, not something that
we weren't willing to do, but

77
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:16,529
something that was a little bit
unexpected. Didn't know going

78
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,560
into it. And then from an
analytical side, like how

79
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,069
helpful was it actually, for us
growing the show? That's what

80
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:24,240
you guys have dug into. Right?

81
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:27,839
Alban: Yeah, I mean, we can talk
a bit about the analytics buzz

82
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,689
cast itself was getting more
attention, let's call it

83
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:37,529
attention than it ever had
before. We were getting between

84
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:45,029
the downloads that continued to
grow on the RSS side. And on the

85
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:48,209
YouTube channel being added to
that it was huge. And then we

86
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:52,920
started doing clips of Buzzcast
episodes. And those were doing

87
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,490
really well. And so if you
wanted to add all that up, it

88
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,259
was like wow, this show is
doubled in sighs This is great.

89
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:08,339
But we on the other side, were
kind of frustrated with the

90
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:13,259
growth of the YouTube channel.
We grew a ton the first year.

91
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:17,610
And we just kind of seen a lot
of slowing down of our growth.

92
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,050
We didn't know exactly why. And
we kept kind of digging into the

93
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,839
data. And I think it might have
been Jonathan first, or maybe it

94
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,959
was Travis, who said, I just
clicked through all of the last

95
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,189
videos. And I noticed most of
the Buzzcast ones lose

96
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:39,779
subscribers. And I was like,
That's not true. And then I

97
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:43,709
click through and went, Oh,
that's definitely true. I was

98
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:48,089
very skeptical by nature. And so
and then we started digging in

99
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:54,779
deeper. And I took, I think it
was like six different stats

100
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:58,500
that we use to kind of quantify
how valuable each individual

101
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,300
video is. And I just went back
and looked at, like the last 90

102
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,519
days, all the videos that were
created during that 90 day

103
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:12,480
period, I think we had 22
videos, or 26 videos, all of the

104
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,540
Buzzcast ones were in the worst
category, they were they

105
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,490
represented, like the very
bottom five episodes, or videos.

106
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,170
And, you know, we, I think
Travis, you had some good ideas

107
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:29,550
of why the Buzzcast ones were
performing near the bottom. But

108
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,699
in the end, we were kind of
doing the thing that we've

109
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,620
always criticized, we've always
criticized people who were

110
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,990
putting a static image on a
YouTube video on a YouTube

111
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,790
video, just having audio, you
know, we said that can crush an

112
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,740
existing valuable YouTube
channel. And we were crushing

113
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:55,500
our existing value bowl YouTube
channel, by adding this, you

114
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,550
know, some of this, basically
podcast content in video format.

115
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,800
Kevin: To clarify, we weren't
crushing it because we weren't

116
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,160
putting the static image when we
were putting real video up. But

117
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,269
we weren't playing in line with
the the rules of YouTube or to

118
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:11,519
use the algorithm in the
smartest and best way we were

119
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,100
confusing the algorithm. We were
publishing different lengths of

120
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,550
content, different formats of
content. And so we ended up is a

121
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,459
very important and valuable
channel for us for marketing our

122
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,769
software and telling the world
about what Buzzsprout can do for

123
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:26,220
you as a podcaster. We were
hurting that marketing channel

124
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,790
for us, right?

125
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:30,750
Alban: Yeah, I guess what I was
saying is, we were not being

126
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,920
hypocritical in the way that we
created the video, the content,

127
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,250
because we weren't publishing
the static image with the audio.

128
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,970
But the reason we say we
recommend everybody else not to

129
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,660
do that, is because what it's
doing is it's showing YouTube

130
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,480
that your content is low
quality, and it's a specific

131
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,670
type of content. It's audio plus
an image. Well, when we were

132
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,389
looking at it, YouTube was used
to a much higher production

133
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:02,639
quality, a very different type
of content for our channel. And

134
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,790
so I think people were
constantly confused. They're

135
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,709
running into videos that they
thought were going to be Travis

136
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:14,490
or Sarah jalon, doing an in
depth tutorial. And they were

137
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,360
clicking, and they were finding
me pontificating about Facebook

138
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,199
podcasts for 20 minutes. So
Travis, give us some more

139
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,009
insight, what's what are the
differentiators between our day

140
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:29,639
to day content are the bread and
butter that we do very well, and

141
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,350
what Buzzcast was doing on our
channel?

142
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,379
Travis: One thing to keep in
mind is when we create content

143
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:38,490
for Podcasting, Q&A, when we
create tutorials, things like

144
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,090
that, we have a very specific
aim for those videos. Right? So

145
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,210
we're trying to answer questions
really well, we're trying to

146
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:49,440
take all the knowledge and best
practices for how to be a

147
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,269
podcaster. And consolidating
that into a form factor. That is

148
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,519
something you could easily watch
in just a few minutes and get

149
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:00,690
all the information that you
need. And because we're able to

150
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:03,600
put that level of focus on it,
like Alan mentioned, the

151
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,960
production quality is better. We
have custom animations, and B

152
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,419
roll, which is just a fancy way
of saying we cut away to

153
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:12,720
different videos of models doing
things that match what we're

154
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,960
talking about on screen. And so
we're able to create a type of

155
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,730
content that works really well
in a YouTube ecosystem. And so

156
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,909
if your whole channel is that
kind of content, then YouTube

157
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:31,379
starts knowing Okay, if someone
we've kind of identified them as

158
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:33,870
a potential podcaster, and
they're asking a podcast related

159
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,690
question, Buzzsprout is going to
be the channel we recommend

160
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,960
because we know they have this
kind of content. The reason that

161
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,220
we split off Buzzcast the full
episodes into a separate channel

162
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,590
a couple of months ago, is
because we noticed that those

163
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:54,210
videos were not performing at
all at the same level as the

164
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:57,750
Podcasting, Q&A and other
tutorial videos were doing. And

165
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,509
that was a common practice we'd
seen with other youtubers That

166
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:03,690
created video podcasts, they
would create new channels for

167
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,029
them. And then if they had
clips, that would be a third

168
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:07,679
channel. So they would actually
have three channels, they'd have

169
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,440
their main YouTube channel, a
full podcast channel and a clips

170
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,129
channel, in order to make sure
that they were kind of playing

171
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:16,679
by the rules, the best practice
of YouTube. So these were all

172
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:19,889
things that we, you know, as we
were experimenting, we weren't

173
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:23,009
sure like, how far are we really
going to carry this book? Like,

174
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:27,690
how invested Are we going to get
into video Buzzcast. And so it

175
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,149
didn't make sense to spin up a
whole YouTube channel, we're

176
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:32,549
just going to do a couple
episodes and then retire it

177
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,970
right. So we tested in our on
our main channel first and said,

178
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,179
Okay, that's working. So then
what if we took the next step,

179
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,669
and we made it consistent? And
then what if we took the next

180
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:44,100
step and made a separate, and so
it's kind of like evolved over

181
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,720
time. And now to Kevin's point,
it's at the place where we just

182
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,440
wanted to make sure, if we keep
going on this trajectory, it's

183
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,919
going to serve you guys, it's
gonna make Buzzcast better for

184
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,279
you. And it's also going to make
sense in the grand scheme of the

185
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,940
other things that we're doing to
produce and create content. And

186
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,480
so we're now at this nexus point
where if we're going to be able

187
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,289
to go back and record in the
studio, you know, that has a

188
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,750
level of production that even
exceeds what we're currently

189
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,370
what we were doing before. And,
and so at this point in time, it

190
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,029
makes more sense for us to pause
it, knowing we can always turn

191
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:24,269
it back on later. But just to
double down and refocus our

192
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:26,940
efforts on the audio only
version of Buzzcast.

193
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:30,629
Alban: So if I can kind of tie
this together with what are the

194
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:35,429
best practices we have learned
for YouTube, and podcasting, in

195
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:40,470
particular, because podcasting
is really growing on YouTube,

196
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:44,850
one out of five people now who
say they listened to podcasts,

197
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,419
they listened to most of their
podcasts on YouTube, one out of

198
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:53,639
five, that's pretty remarkably
high numbers. That comes from

199
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,659
Edison research. I actually
interviewed Tom Webster this

200
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:01,289
morning, and he told me that so
it's definitely working there.

201
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:06,059
But it takes a lot to make it
work. And it was not stuff that

202
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,019
was going to make sense for us
to do. So. I think to do

203
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,129
podcasts, well on YouTube, you
probably need to be recording a

204
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:19,620
person so that you have that
live engaging element. Because I

205
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,490
don't know how to say this
exactly. But like, the level of

206
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,620
engagement you want to see
between the hosts during a audio

207
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:33,029
and a video medium is very
different. Right now, like I can

208
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:36,240
see Kevin and Travis and like
Kevin looks kind of

209
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,330
disinterested. That doesn't
bother anybody who's just

210
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,340
listening to this because they
go, Oh, Kevin's probably

211
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:48,059
listening attentively. But you
know what? But if we're on

212
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,059
video, I'd be the first comment
we ever got on one of our

213
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:54,570
Buzzcast episodes was why does
albot look so mad. And I was

214
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,190
like, Oh, that's just my face
looks. That's just me. Like,

215
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,629
that's just me not smiling. And
so that works perfectly fine.

216
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:07,230
When you're recording long
distance recordings. When it's

217
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:11,549
on video, it starts to look a
little weird. And you can either

218
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,509
kind of over fake enthusiasm, or
you can get together in an audio

219
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:19,379
studio get together in a studio
in person. So like, get together

220
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:23,370
in person, I think is a very
high recommendation, they should

221
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:28,200
try to get that number, you
know, if at all possible, then

222
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,379
you've also got to have like
multiple shots to be able to

223
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:34,470
keep it interesting. So that's
probably a camera on each host.

224
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:38,700
Maybe an additional wide angle
camera, you can see that we've

225
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,090
experimented this in some of our
Podcasting Q&A videos is

226
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,929
rolling, I think three different
cameras now all at once, and

227
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:50,700
then we flipped between them.
For us to do the three of us in

228
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,110
the studio would require us
probably to be shooting like

229
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,909
four or five cameras at a time.
And then the, you know, that

230
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:03,330
really ramps up the amount of
video editing that we're doing.

231
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,509
Okay, so we're buying a bunch of
cameras. We're buying, we're

232
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:09,960
doing more in video editing.
We're getting us all together in

233
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,259
the studio in the most
dangerous, dangerous COVID

234
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:17,789
hotspot United States right now.
So three negatives, and all for

235
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:21,090
the benefit of starting a new
YouTube channel that isn't

236
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,929
exactly in alignment with what
we want. So that's to kind of

237
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:28,289
wrap it up quickly. What how
we're thinking about this. Maybe

238
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:32,340
we come back, maybe not. But
until next time, listen to us on

239
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,710
our RSS backed podcast.

240
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:38,668
Travis: Yes, we are definitely
not going anywhere. You'll just

241
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:41,399
need to listen to us anywhere
except for Spotify will be.

242
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:45,269
Alban: This is basically Apple
podcasts and indie apps

243
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,269
exclusive now. Yeah, I would say
so. I would say so.

244
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:50,849
Kevin: Yeah. I think it's an
interesting point that you

245
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,339
talked about when you talk about
your interview with Tom Webster

246
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,219
and he's saying that one in five
podcasts are roughly 20% of

247
00:14:56,249 --> 00:14:59,969
people listening the podcast in
YouTube, and I can't help it

248
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:05,399
think that that is it just don't
think that there's a stat that

249
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,259
we should just take without some
additional thought, right? Like

250
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,538
listening to a podcast and
YouTube is a different

251
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,989
experience than what a lot of us
who produce podcasts are in the

252
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:18,089
podcasting space probably think
about when we think about

253
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:21,328
podcasting, like the benefits in
the beauty of podcasting is it's

254
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:23,908
it's passive, it's something
that you can do not only on

255
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:26,068
demand, but at your convenience
while you're doing other things

256
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:27,899
while you're doing housework
while you're exercising, while

257
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,328
you're at work while you're
driving a car, you the YouTube

258
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:34,229
experience is different than
that. And so while the YouTube

259
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:37,198
ecosystem is huge, and it might
be a lot more mainstream in

260
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:39,239
terms of the number of people
who engage in that space, and

261
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,818
then at some point, click on
something that is calling itself

262
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:45,928
a podcast, it's, it might just
be an exposure thing, it might

263
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:47,849
just be the size of the
ecosystem thing, it might not

264
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:52,048
necessarily be what we would
consider a podcast and all the

265
00:15:52,048 --> 00:15:53,938
great benefits that go along
with podcasting. And I don't

266
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:56,788
want to get into the details of
is it does it really have an RSS

267
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,438
feed and all that stuff, that's
not really what I'm talking

268
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:00,658
about. I'm just kind of talking
about the size of the medium and

269
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:02,999
the number of people who at some
point during their normal day,

270
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,788
flip open YouTube, and might
click on something that is

271
00:16:05,788 --> 00:16:11,129
calling itself a podcast. So
that being said, YouTube is a

272
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:13,769
fine place for you to distribute
content and being creator. But

273
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:16,288
hopefully, there's some
takeaways from what we've

274
00:16:16,288 --> 00:16:18,719
experienced over the past year,
pressing into the YouTube Space

275
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:22,438
a little bit in terms of putting
a podcast onto YouTube, there's

276
00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:25,828
a lot more that goes into it
than just recording a zoom call,

277
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:28,109
and then throwing it up there.
If you really want to succeed,

278
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:30,058
you have to understand the
algorithm, you have to

279
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:32,188
understand how the medium works,
you have to understand what type

280
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:35,249
of content works there is, this
is a larger level of commitment.

281
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,188
And you might find a huge
audience and huge following

282
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:43,259
there. But it's probably not
going to be it's not an

283
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,269
overnight success. It is a lot
of work. And it is very

284
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:47,849
different than audio only
podcasting. So as we continue to

285
00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:52,558
unpack, and learn things about
how to use YouTube, or other

286
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:55,649
channels to grow your main
podcast, your audio only

287
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:58,379
podcast, it's distributed
through RSS, we will continue to

288
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:00,178
share those learnings with you
and hopefully make you a better

289
00:17:00,178 --> 00:17:03,719
podcaster. But this is where we
are today. And the decisions

290
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:07,648
we've made. So this podcast will
not be on YouTube, and not in

291
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:11,638
video form. And as we learn more
and grow more, we'll share all

292
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:12,179
our learnings with

293
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,609
Travis: so if you've been a
Buzzcast listener for any length

294
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:21,900
of time, you know, we're big
fans of the podcast index and

295
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,079
podcasting 2.0, that entire
group, that entire working group

296
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,279
of people dedicating themselves
to improving the open podcast

297
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,000
ecosystem, and creating really
fun new features that allow you

298
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,420
as a creator, to make awesome
content and help your listeners

299
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,349
really engage with your show in
some really unique ways. Kevin

300
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:44,069
and Tom had an opportunity to
sit down with Dave Jones, who is

301
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:47,309
working on the podcast index and
podcasting 2.0 to talk about a

302
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:52,170
new feature that Buzzsprout is
now supporting, and also tease

303
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,839
out some fun new things that
they have coming down the

304
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:57,960
pipeline. So here's that
conversation between Kevin Tom

305
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,009
and Dave Jones.

306
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:01,589
Tom: This is Tom Rossi,
technical co founder of

307
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:06,990
Buzzsprout. And I am glad to be
joined by Dave Jones, one of the

308
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,109
two guys running the podcast
index, Dave Jones and Adam curry

309
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:13,859
have been doing amazing work
with the podcast index. Dave,

310
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,910
welcome to the show. Thanks for
all that you're doing. Tell us a

311
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,640
little bit about the podcast
index and what you guys are

312
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,269
doing over there.

313
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,640
Dave: Let's see, what are we
doing at the podcast? And what

314
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,839
are we not doing at podcast?

315
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,819
Kevin: So Dave, the podcasting
to auto project is like it

316
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:32,700
incorporates the podcast index
and the podcasting namespace

317
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,650
right and a whole bunch of
things. Can you tell us like

318
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,690
what's the difference? What are
the two functions that those

319
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,880
those two things sort of where
they come together? How does it

320
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,299
all work?

321
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,480
Dave: Yeah, we get this question
a lot. What the heck are y'all

322
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,630
doing with all these various
projects? And then what did they

323
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:51,509
even mean? And so podcasting 2.0
is the name of our podcast, but

324
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:54,359
it's also the name of the
broader movement of trying to

325
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:57,269
preserve, protect and extend the
open RSS ecosystem,

326
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,009
Kevin: right. When we say this,
this is a little bit different

327
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:01,680
than what like fireside chat
introduced it podcast movement,

328
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,109
is podcasting to Dotto, right.
Yeah,

329
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:07,680
Dave: I gotta hope it is
completely different. Yeah, but

330
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,289
podcasting. 2.0 is just an open
source, volunteer movement of

331
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:17,130
people coming up with ideas and
launching projects to help

332
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:21,750
preserve the open RSS ecosystem
of podcasting, and podcasting

333
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:24,539
inside the app. So pod inside
podcasting 2.0. But that would

334
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,970
be the podcast namespace where
all these new features and tags

335
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,029
are coming from. Also within
podcasting, 2.0 would be

336
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:33,720
something like pod ping, which
allows hosts to rapidly notified

337
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,930
apps and aggregators of new
episodes, things like that.

338
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,230
That's all in the podcasting 2.0
side of things. The podcast

339
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:44,849
index is the thing that we
created at the very beginning in

340
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:48,150
order to facilitate all these
other things. So the podcast

341
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,390
index is the largest directory
of podcasts on the internet.

342
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,829
It's were like 4.1 million
podcasts right now feeds. We are

343
00:19:55,829 --> 00:20:01,710
a directory and also an API for
podcast app. to hook in to get

344
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,289
their podcast data from,
basically, they just start

345
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:08,220
coding an app, they plug into us
and they get all their data in,

346
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:12,210
it saves them a world of hurt on
that side of things. So those,

347
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,470
the podcasts index is the APN
directory, but geisen 2.0 is all

348
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,599
the features and community
movement.

349
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,349
Kevin: Right, and then huge
opportunity with the index is

350
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:24,930
that we're not tied in or
reliant on Apple anymore. So

351
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,910
like over the past two or three
months, Apple's directory has

352
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,609
been having a ton of problems.
Not to mention even before that,

353
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:31,769
when it was working, well, it
would take you probably a

354
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,769
minimum of two or three days up
to a couple weeks to even get in

355
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,710
Apple podcast directory, then
when you publish a new episode,

356
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,950
it might be 24 hours or more
before that new episode gets

357
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,740
released in search showing up on
any of the apps that rely on

358
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,950
that directory. And the index
solves all that along with other

359
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,440
technologies that you're
developing as well like the pod

360
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,460
paying and everything else.
Right.

361
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,519
Dave: Yeah, we started this
whole project with with the

362
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,700
directory and the API with the
idea that we wanted to take

363
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:02,250
Apple Apple's directory away
from being the center of the

364
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,430
podcasting universe, which has
been for, you know, 15 years at

365
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:10,710
least. And the idea there was
that, you know, no, no knock on

366
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,319
Apple, I mean, they've been good
stewards of podcasting, it's

367
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,819
just that it doesn't make a lot
of sense for an open

368
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,549
specification, like podcasting,
an open system that anybody can

369
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:29,069
participate in, it does not make
a lot of sense for that. To be

370
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:33,180
controlled by a single humongous
entity like apple, I mean,

371
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,670
they're literally the biggest
company in the world. And so

372
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,890
it's sort of like you have this
weird spectrum where you got

373
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,819
podcasting, which is completely
open, I can hand write an RSS

374
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:45,150
feed today, and get into the
inbox and create a podcast. And

375
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,779
I can do it from my computer in
five minutes. But then you have

376
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:52,559
the directory where all the
podcasts are found, his career

377
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:56,220
is controlled by this huge
corporation. So it really just

378
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,059
didn't didn't make a lot of
sense, the goal there was create

379
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:03,930
a directory that is completely
open, anybody can join it,

380
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,230
anybody can add to it, anybody
can put their podcast into it in

381
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:12,059
15 seconds. And then the next
step, which is the which is the

382
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:15,509
part that has to happen, make it
available for free, and

383
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:18,690
everybody can download it, you
can download it our entire

384
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:23,220
database right now from our From
the homepage of our website, and

385
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:25,470
do whatever you want with it,
you can go create your own

386
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,710
directory or your own API or
your own apps. So if it's not

387
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,069
free, then it doesn't solve any
of the problem. And if you have

388
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:34,349
to have us, it still doesn't
solve the problem. You need to

389
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:37,109
be we need to redistribute it.
And so that's what we that was

390
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:38,039
the Gulf in the beginning.

391
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,890
Tom: One of the features that
I'm most excited about out of

392
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,190
podcasting 2.0 is pod ping, can
you tell us a little bit about

393
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:44,460
that?

394
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:47,430
Dave: Yeah, sure. podcasting
suffers from the same thing that

395
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:52,769
all RSS based infrastructure
does it, what you have is a

396
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:55,890
system where you publish an
episode of whatever this is, or

397
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,329
a blog post or anything, any bit
of information, you publish that

398
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:04,289
to an RSS feed, think of it like
a WordPress blog. So then the

399
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:07,349
RSS feed, which is just a file
on a web server somewhere, it

400
00:23:07,349 --> 00:23:10,440
gets updated. How does the rest
of the world know that you've

401
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,650
just put a blog post up on your
website, they have to be

402
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,579
notified, or they have to go and
check in there's, there's the

403
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:20,940
only two ways to get that
information. So just think of it

404
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,329
like, you know, clicking on a
website refresh button over and

405
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:27,779
over and over just to see if
something new pops up. That's

406
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:31,440
essentially what all of these
infrastructures have to do,

407
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,019
whether it's podcasting or
blogosphere, or any of these

408
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:37,079
things. It's just what you
resort to is just checking the

409
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,279
website over and over and over.

410
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:40,619
Tom: And this is this is one of
the things that we see all the

411
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,259
time, right, where we have
podcasters, who will publish an

412
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:46,950
episode. And then they're
wondering, Well, where is it? I

413
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,710
published it an hour ago? Why
don't I see it anywhere? Why

414
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,440
don't I see it on Apple? Why
don't I see it on Spotify? And I

415
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,190
think what what's exciting about
pod pain is this is a solution

416
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,539
to that problem, which is if you
subscribe to a feed with with

417
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,779
pod pain, you'll know whenever
it gets updated. You'll know

418
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:04,769
about it immediately.

419
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,849
Dave: Yeah, and that's a just a
reversal of that whole thing of

420
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,400
instead of checking over and
over and over for new content.

421
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,119
We tell you, you know, the
publisher tells you when there's

422
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:15,660
content,

423
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,630
Tom: pod ping solves two
problems. One is the polling

424
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:22,470
with RSS feeds. And then you
also have the problem of much of

425
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,450
the web sub pub pub is built on
Google, which isn't reliable. So

426
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,089
pod ping does it in a reliable
way. And so as I've talked to

427
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:32,009
people about pod paying, and
they said, Well, don't we

428
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:33,930
already have a solution for
this? Well, we don't have a

429
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,259
reliable solution for this. And
so that's why a lot of people

430
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:40,920
just continue to pull RSS feeds.
So really excited about the work

431
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,730
that you did with with pod Ping.
One of the features of the

432
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:47,490
podcast namespace that we've
just implemented at Buzzsprout.

433
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,390
That I'm sure everyone would
love to hear why we did it. Is

434
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,009
the gu ID, or the gu ID. How do
you say Dave gwit? Yeah, let's

435
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:59,250
Duguid. Goo it sounds gross.
Let's do good. There's no way

436
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,220
around it that it's He's gonna
sound gross. So but tell us

437
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,599
what, what's the grid? And why
do you want podcasting companies

438
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:09,569
like Buzzsprout and podcasters.
to include this in their RSS

439
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:09,869
feed,

440
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:15,329
Dave: a grid is a globally
unique identifier, geo ID. It is

441
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,279
a long number that uniquely
identifies a thing and object

442
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:25,950
globally in the world. It's this
thing is this number. And so

443
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:29,970
that is a thing that Apple's
directory has always had.

444
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,069
Everybody's podcast has an
iTunes ID, or an apple podcast

445
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:40,410
ID. And if you go and look for
your podcast on Apple's podcast

446
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,990
directory, you can see at the
end of the little URL in the

447
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,619
address bar up there, you can
see your Apple ID, because Apple

448
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:49,170
has been the center of the
podcasting universe for so long,

449
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:54,420
that iTunes ID has become the
way that many apps identify a

450
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:59,220
podcast in there's problems with
that. We solve those problems

451
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:04,559
earlier this year, when Apple's
API stopped returning the

452
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,000
location of where podcast live
at. So they stopped returning in

453
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,200
their API for many, many feeds,
they stopped returning the

454
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,890
actual URL, which is would be
like, you know, buzzsprout.com

455
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,190
slash such and such. That's a
huge problem because it broke

456
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:24,180
tons of apps. And we were on the
front lines of that, because a

457
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,789
lot of people started using our
API when that happened, because

458
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:28,410
it broke and broke their app.

459
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,650
Kevin: Is this stuff going to
help us move in the direction of

460
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,039
like global comments, global
ratings and reviews? Are you

461
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,970
guys working on infrastructure
to be able to allow podcasters

462
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,539
to leave a five star rating in
one app that then translates

463
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:45,960
over to another app or a comment
over here on pod friend that

464
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,390
could get posted in pod chaser?

465
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,539
Dave: Yeah, I hope so. I mean,
that's the idea. That's, that's

466
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:52,980
absolutely the goal with this.

467
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,640
Tom: Just a quick note for our
Buzzsprout listeners, don't you

468
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,730
don't have to write into the
port and ask us to put a grid on

469
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,029
your RSS feed, they're already
there. So all these features

470
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:06,089
whenever we can we want to
implement them without having to

471
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:09,420
require, you know, any, any kind
of, you know, technical

472
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,420
knowledge on our podcasters. And
so, yes, the goods are already

473
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,970
there. And we continue to follow
all the work that Dave and Adam

474
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,400
are doing, and we will implement
those features as they come up.

475
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:21,059
Dave, thank you for being on the
show. Thank you for all the work

476
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:24,960
that you're doing to help make
podcasting. Awesome. We

477
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,430
appreciate it. And thanks for
being here.

478
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,039
Kevin: Yeah, thanks, guys.
Appreciate it. listeners, please

479
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:32,130
check out podcast index.org
click on apps, download a new

480
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:35,700
podcast app, recommend it to
your listening audience. And

481
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,789
yeah, support the movement. It's
really good stuff for podcasting.

482
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:45,170
Travis: So we asked the good
people of the internet, namely

483
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,049
on our YouTube community chats
if you subscribe to the YouTube,

484
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:50,269
the main Buzzsprout YouTube
channel, you may have seen this

485
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:54,380
in your subscriber feed. Alban
asked on Twitter, we also posted

486
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,630
in the Facebook group, the
Buzzsprout podcast, Facebook

487
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,049
group, just your questions. So
we're going to run through a

488
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:04,460
lightning round, have a bunch of
questions and hopefully will

489
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,279
give you some okay answers.
Alright, so the first question,

490
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:09,769
Alban, I want to see this off to
you first, because you're going

491
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:12,559
to be the best person to answer
this question. This is from

492
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,609
Arielle, she asks, Why is Alban
the coolest? No,

493
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:21,289
Alban: no, no. Why is Alban the
coolest? My response to that

494
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:24,619
because that was to my asking
people questions was please

495
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,519
delete this. So yeah, no answer
to that. plead the fifth. Hmm.

496
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,690
Next question.

497
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:32,869
Travis: Kevin, do you have a
rebuttal response?

498
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:35,839
Kevin: I agree. It's puzzling.
He is the coolest. Nobody really

499
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,559
can explain why but she's right.
Ariel, one of our good friends.

500
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,500
Just start a podcast movement
works with squad cast. Awesome

501
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,170
software. Awesome People. So
check them out. Thanks for the

502
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,210
question. Ariel. Sorry, we don't
have a better answer for you.

503
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,140
Travis: He just is. It's just
the sky is blue. Alban is cool.

504
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:56,420
And podcasts are awesome. Next
question comes from Julio. And

505
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:02,809
Julio wants to know about
automatic social promotion. Is

506
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:05,269
there an automatic way to post
to social media accounts

507
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:08,599
automatically from your RSS
feed? Okay,

508
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:13,549
Alban: so yes, there is a way to
do it. I think the way that I've

509
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:16,279
seen most people do it is
through Zapier or Zapier,

510
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:19,190
depending on how you want to
pronounce that name, it's, you

511
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,880
know, you pretty much have it,
check the podcast feed once an

512
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,259
hour or something if there's new
episode, then kick off these

513
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:32,329
tweets and these social posts.
So there's a way to do it. I

514
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:36,559
would advise Julio not to do it,
though. This is one of the

515
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,700
marketing things that like
everybody really wants an

516
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,609
automated solution for we're
like, wouldn't it be cool if I

517
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:47,180
didn't have to write all my
tweets, instead, I just did the

518
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,500
thing I'm already doing and then
some software. Sometimes people

519
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,180
say AI, even if it's not AI,
that some thing will go and do

520
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,240
all the work for me. And that
would be cool. It'd be very

521
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,750
cool. What It ends up happening
is, you end up tweeting the

522
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:08,630
exact same tweet, once a week,
or four times a week with just

523
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:13,700
different links. And the only
people I know who I've seen do

524
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,480
this, it's like, those don't get
any engagement. No one's liking

525
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,460
them. Because the algorithm can
see and like your followers can

526
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,779
see, like, just a link to some
random website plus your

527
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:32,690
boilerplate text. Much, much
better would be for you, if you

528
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:37,069
think there's a quotable element
of your podcast to go create a

529
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:42,109
audio gram or a soundbite and
share that. If you're

530
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:45,289
overwhelmed by all the
promotion, like I've got five

531
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:49,099
different social channels and
only one person to do all the

532
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:52,849
work. Well, then the right
answer, I think, is pick one

533
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:57,799
social channel and write one
tweet, one Instagram post one

534
00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:01,670
story, whatever it may be, for
each episode, and get that out

535
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,349
there. And you will I think, do
better just by doing one manual

536
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,130
action than trying to set up
this automated solution that

537
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:14,839
will pretty quickly fade into
the background noise of Twitter

538
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,930
and the rest of the social
platform. So my recommendation

539
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:18,950
is probably don't do it.

540
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,650
Kevin: Alright, good advice. And
if you decide not to take

541
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:29,779
Alban's advice that SAP yours
EAP i e r dot get answered. Next

542
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:33,500
question came in from we don't
know who anonymous question is,

543
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,220
should we auto distribute to
YouTube? timely question, we

544
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,819
Travis: just this is a similar
question. So I would say, go

545
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:43,579
back to the first part of this
episode, where we talked about

546
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:48,319
why we're pausing video
Buzzcast. It is the rare

547
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:55,700
exception. Where a podcast can
auto publish a video of a still

548
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,359
image with an audio file playing
in the background and have any

549
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,509
level of success and we're
talking, I can count on like one

550
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:05,029
hand, the number of podcasts
that I know, do this, and they

551
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:07,549
have they do you get some
traction. I'm thinking Tim

552
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:10,460
Ferriss, I'm thinking of all but
like not very many beyond that.

553
00:32:11,089 --> 00:32:13,039
And that's simply because it's
not what YouTube is built for

554
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,240
people don't go to YouTube to
not watch something, they go to

555
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,589
YouTube to watch videos. So any
kind of automated YouTube

556
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:26,480
distribution is going to strip
the video element out. And that

557
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,250
kind of defeats the purpose of
putting it on YouTube,

558
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:31,279
Alban: start with the video, and
then take the audio to put on

559
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,059
your podcast. The other way
around is not as valuable. Sorry

560
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:36,259
to interrupt your question traps.

561
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,359
Travis: No, that was a perfectly
fine way to sum it up.

562
00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:41,960
Kevin: Good advice. Next
question came in from Rick, how

563
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,339
long should your podcast title
be?

564
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:46,849
Travis: Here's the good news.
There are no rules that I'm

565
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:49,880
aware of other than, you know,
there's a certain maximum number

566
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,009
of characters Kevin, do you know
off the top of your head? What

567
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:53,869
the max number of characters is
for?

568
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,730
Kevin: It's got to be it's got
to be big?

569
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:58,400
Alban: It's something like 255,
right? Yeah,

570
00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:02,059
Travis: it's quite long. So if
it fits in a tweet, you can make

571
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:06,619
it an episode title. So the
strategy becomes how do you

572
00:33:07,099 --> 00:33:10,789
create an episode title that
gets your listeners to say, I am

573
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:14,869
going to listen to another
episode this week. Or if you're

574
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:17,990
using some kind of podcast SEO
strategy, where you're trying to

575
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:22,069
get those episodes to show up
inside of podcast apps, then

576
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:23,930
you'd want to make sure that the
title captured those those

577
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:28,369
keywords. There's no rhyme or
reason to how long the title

578
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:31,220
should be. There are some
podcasts that have quite long

579
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,380
titles, again, thinking about
the Tim Ferriss show where he

580
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,619
has like the whole summary of
the episode in the title. And

581
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:39,049
depending on the app that
someone's listening to it in,

582
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:41,779
you'll see more or less of it.
And then you'll see the little

583
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:45,769
ellipses at the end, if it's
runs over the kind of like a lot

584
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:50,089
of space there. But in general,
just hit the high point, what's

585
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:52,910
the main thing people can expect
to get out of the episode, make

586
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,940
it really clear up front, and
however long it needs to be is

587
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,960
how long it needs to be.

588
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,660
Kevin: Yeah, and I'll throw in
my little tip because I listened

589
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,349
so much in the car. And I use
Apple CarPlay to do that. And

590
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:06,079
whatever app you're using
everything in the Apple CarPlay

591
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,289
interfaces is blown up huge. And
so you really don't see very

592
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:11,570
many characters at all. So I
would say regardless of how long

593
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,909
your episode titles are, I don't
know that that's super

594
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:16,369
important. But please put the
most important information at

595
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:19,219
the front like we'll use the Tim
Ferriss example, because you

596
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:21,829
already brought it up. But like
I already know it's Tim Ferriss

597
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:24,530
show, so don't say Tim Ferriss
show podcast episode number yet,

598
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:27,559
like that's gonna be the same
for every single episode put,

599
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:31,190
like the guest name first, like
Tell me who's on there. So

600
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,289
regardless of the app that I'm
using, or how much they decide

601
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:35,960
to show, I'm seeing the relevant
information at the beginning,

602
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:39,469
not the same thing over and over
for every episode. Indeed,

603
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:43,670
Travis: wise words. Kevin, I
want to queue this one up to you

604
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,860
as our technical expert here.
This is from dog tail storytime,

605
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:53,420
podcast can turntables free
features help you grow your

606
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:55,969
audience because there is a free
chargeable and then you can pay

607
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:56,809
for some other stuff,

608
00:34:56,989 --> 00:35:00,380
Kevin: right? So here's what I
would say about charitable I'm

609
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,650
not exactly up to date on what
they give you in their free plan

610
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:07,250
versus the different paid tiers.
And one of the reasons that I'm

611
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,610
not is because of the way that
charitable, like implements

612
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:15,619
their technology, they to use
most of the powerful features of

613
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:20,000
charitable you, they're gonna
want you to put in a URL prefix

614
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,800
on your RSS feed. So that's
something that you can totally

615
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,289
do as a Buzzsprout podcaster, we
don't limit you or not let you

616
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:28,579
do that, you can absolutely do
that. But what I'm not familiar

617
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:31,070
with enough, because we've just
never looked into doing it

618
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:34,670
ourselves is, we as soon as you
do that, you turn over all your

619
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,340
privacy, like all all the
information, your IP addresses

620
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,190
of all of your audience to
chargeable. And I know that they

621
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:44,840
do some attribution. So they
then have code that different

622
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,360
businesses can put on their
websites to look for overlapping

623
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,519
IP addresses between the people
who are downloading podcast

624
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,070
episodes and the people who are
landing on websites. And then

625
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,840
what they're doing on those
websites like, are they buying

626
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,599
certain products? Are they
checking out, they use some of

627
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:59,420
that technology to retarget
them. So if they show up, they

628
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,179
listen to this episode, and they
land on this website, they might

629
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:05,030
want to show them an ad for
something similar from another

630
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,599
podcast or something. All of
that stuff kind of goes against

631
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:13,340
things that I'm into things that
I get excited about. it rubs me

632
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:15,530
it rubs my privacy button the
wrong way. Like I don't love

633
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:20,000
tracking, I love. I love
targeting, like the idea that

634
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,329
saying, hey, this podcast is
intended for this type of

635
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:26,989
audience. So if you're a podcast
sponsor, then that's something

636
00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:29,360
that you should look at, because
this is content that's geared

637
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,610
towards people who are into
motorcycles, and who are the

638
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,559
types of people that are into
motorcycles? Well, it's mostly

639
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:36,409
these types of people. But we
can't identify any individual

640
00:36:36,409 --> 00:36:39,079
motorcycle owner and say that
they also have this level of

641
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,340
education or could be this
gender, or might be this level

642
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,440
of household income. Like
that's, that's where the line

643
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,869
crosses for me. And charitable
is kind of more into the other

644
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:50,719
stuff. And so I don't know a
whole lot about it. But I would

645
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,460
tell you that if you're
interested in exploring

646
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,320
charitable, please read their
terms of service, please make

647
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,320
sure that you're comfortable as
a podcaster, that as soon as you

648
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,469
start hooking up their, your,
their tools to your podcast,

649
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:04,670
you're going to expose some
level of your listeners, your

650
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:07,789
privacy to them, and I don't
know what they do with it. So

651
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,820
please do some research before
you get into that. Not saying

652
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,269
it's not the smart move for you.
But just educate yourself before

653
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:14,599
you do it.

654
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:20,659
Travis: Next question is from
Stephen. And he has some premium

655
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:23,659
content that it seems like he
already has on Patreon. And so

656
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:28,369
his question is about adding
that premium content to Spotify

657
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:33,349
and Apple podcasts. So in
addition to Patreon, should he

658
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:36,260
offer subscriptions directly on
Spotify, or Apple?

659
00:37:36,949 --> 00:37:40,099
Alban: So the answer to Stephen
will be a little different than

660
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:43,190
for everybody else. Steven is
actually the podcast host and

661
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:48,409
producer, Apple Insider. So he
does a lot of pretty produced

662
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:52,219
podcast episodes. It's very
tempting to say, Oh, of course,

663
00:37:52,219 --> 00:37:55,429
do it. Why not put your podcast
episode everywhere? Because

664
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,010
that's what I would want to do
is make it easy for people who

665
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,639
are on Spotify to subscribe,
make it easy for people on Apple

666
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:05,510
to subscribe, make it easy for
anybody, anywhere else to

667
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:11,510
subscribe via Patreon. Why not?
Well, the why not is the amount

668
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:16,429
of work that that could take. So
there's quite a few. There's

669
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:21,380
just an article I read about I
believe was NPR was NPR hiring

670
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:25,579
two different people. And their
primary responsibilities was

671
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:29,300
uploading all of the podcasting
content to all these different

672
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,989
platforms. And double checking
to make sure they did the ads

673
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:37,579
free version there. This one got
that bonus content. This one, we

674
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:40,940
gave it the right title, blah,
blah, blah, being put everywhere

675
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:45,050
on the web, if you're an indie
podcaster. And you're just

676
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,849
saying, hey, I want to
experiment and see if I can make

677
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:51,230
a little money. Well, man, this
is really not a exciting

678
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:55,309
proposition, to add multiple
hours to your workflow to make

679
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:58,909
sure that your podcast episode
is put up all over the place.

680
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,329
But if you are a larger team,
and you have the resources of

681
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:04,940
something like Apple insider
behind you, like Stephen does,

682
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,809
that may well be worth the, you
know, the time and effort to

683
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:12,170
make sure it's as easy as
possible. The only slight

684
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:16,429
caveat, I guess I'd give it the
end is for Steve in particular,

685
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,699
the podcast is Apple and cider
is for people who are really

686
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:23,090
into Apple products. If they're
really into Apple products,

687
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,030
they're probably using Apple
podcasts or one of the other

688
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:31,159
dominant iOS apps. I just be
surprised if they got a huge

689
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:35,690
following over on Spotify as
paid platforms. But it'd be

690
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:39,860
interesting to see that but
yeah, so that's maybe how I

691
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,719
would think about that question.
Yeah,

692
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,110
Kevin: let me jump in here
quick. This is a bit of a

693
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:48,739
tangent off of the paid
subscription workflow in the

694
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:50,809
amount of work that you put into
it. Something to keep in mind,

695
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,750
you might hear oftentimes,
people say, make sure you have a

696
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,789
large enough following before
you start going into premium

697
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:58,789
content. And the reason that
like we've given that

698
00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:01,190
recommendation and other people
As well as because it's the same

699
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,800
amount of work whether you end
up with one subscriber or 10,000

700
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,980
subscribers Exactly. And so
you're making a commitment to

701
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,599
the people who decide to give
you money for your premium

702
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,639
content that you're going to do
as extra work every week, you're

703
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,679
going to do the bonus episodes,
you're going to do the ad free

704
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,690
version, whatever it is that
you're promising, you're going

705
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,360
to do that whether one person
decides to pay you $5 a month,

706
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,500
or 50,000 do. And so make what
we say make sure you have a

707
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,510
large enough following before
you take this commitment. It's

708
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,449
because when we when you launch,
we want you to have enough

709
00:40:26,449 --> 00:40:29,480
income coming in from your
premium offerings to justify the

710
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,150
effort that goes into it. And it
can be a large amount of effort.

711
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,400
So just think that through
before you jump into any

712
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,690
subscription or premium offering,

713
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:40,670
Travis: the next question comes
from Al Pete's, hey, longtime

714
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:44,630
listener, first time caller, how
important friend, how important

715
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:48,320
is it to have a team behind you
with your podcast?

716
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:52,909
Alban: Okay, well, to quote
Marilyn Monroe, maybe I'll save

717
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:56,750
this for later. I'm not I'm not
lucky locked in on you've got to

718
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:00,170
have a team. I mean, the Marilyn
Monroe quote, it's better to be

719
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:05,809
unhappy, alone and unhappy with
someone else. So I think this is

720
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:08,780
the way I've approached it.
Maybe I'm in a dark place of my

721
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,199
life.

722
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,260
Kevin: But there's another quote
that says misery loves company,

723
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,909
like those conflict.

724
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:16,940
Alban: Yeah, misery loves
company means like, if other

725
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,130
people are miserable, then
they're going to want to like

726
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,909
make you miserable, too, right.
And Marilyn, and rose saying,

727
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:26,690
like, I'm already having a rough
go of it. I don't need another

728
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,480
person who's having a rough go
of it. Also kind of venting

729
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,530
their stuff on to me, too.

730
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:31,969
Kevin: You think they're
complimentary. Okay,

731
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,460
Alban: I use if you're on a good
team, and it is a joy to work

732
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,829
with other people. It really is
like, it is so stinking nice to

733
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:46,099
like, show up and record this
show. And Travis has already put

734
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:51,349
together an outline, Kevin's got
suggestions, I throw my thoughts

735
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:55,250
into the mix. And then Travis
goes and does all the work from

736
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:59,900
there to it's out into the wild.
And I don't see anything. That's

737
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,349
an absolute joy for at least two
thirds of the team. Yeah, I

738
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:08,690
mean, exactly. But if you're on
a team, where let's say you're

739
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,480
the one making the outline, and
you're the one kind of carrying

740
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,170
the conversation, and you're
splitting the money three ways,

741
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,239
you know, let's say you're
actually making some money off

742
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:21,860
the show, it can get old, and it
can get really old, if like,

743
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:25,789
people are also changing the
recording time, or they're

744
00:42:25,789 --> 00:42:28,670
supposed to create the social
media posts, but they don't. But

745
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:33,679
you're still editing the post
editing it. And we really

746
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:36,739
appreciate Travis, but I think
there's a lot of editors and

747
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,360
podcast producers, who don't get
a lot of credit for the amount

748
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,699
of work and thought that goes in
to that part of the show. The

749
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,400
the face, the voice of the show,
often is the one getting all the

750
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,070
credit. And so I would boil that
all down to sometimes it's

751
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:02,239
really great to be on a team,
sometimes it can be tough. And I

752
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:05,630
am constantly impressed by very
small teams that what they're

753
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:10,099
able to get done. The You know,
my first job ever was working

754
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:13,849
for the government, when I was
17, working in a library. And

755
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:16,670
like you just saw how slow
everything moved. And now

756
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,429
working on a really, really
small team that builds

757
00:43:19,429 --> 00:43:22,579
Buzzsprout. It's a lot of fun to
see how quickly we can get

758
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:28,579
things done. So I think in some
future life where I'm a, you

759
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:31,010
know, I think anything, I would
not want to be on a smaller

760
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:34,369
team, not a bigger team. And
there's people in the podcasting

761
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:38,000
space who have teams of two or
three. And I bet that they're

762
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,170
loving it that way. So certain
things can only happen if you're

763
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:46,190
really big. But if you're small,
I think it's a good thing to

764
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,280
enjoy it and maybe don't grow
unless there really is a good

765
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,329
reason to do so.

766
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:52,550
Kevin: Yeah, let me tackle the
same question from a different

767
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:55,190
angle. Because you could also
look at it as like, what do you

768
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:58,789
have more of time or money if
you love doing your podcast, and

769
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:01,309
it's successful for you. And
whether you're doing it alone or

770
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:03,559
interviewing somebody
necessarily great, but you don't

771
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:05,960
have all the time to put into
the promotion, or you're not

772
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,440
giving it as much love as Mark,
you're not giving as much

773
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,099
marketing love as you would like
to or you don't have time to

774
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:15,980
edit it to the level of quality
that you want to then those are

775
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,989
things that money might be able
to solve for you. So you might

776
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:22,489
be able to maybe team isn't the
best word maybe it's it's think

777
00:44:22,489 --> 00:44:25,340
about it in terms of help, like,
how important is it to have

778
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,369
help? Well, if you have
resources on the money side

779
00:44:28,429 --> 00:44:30,829
moreso than on the time side,
then I think that's fantastic.

780
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,489
Well, a lot of us have more time
than money. And so in which case

781
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:36,559
you can learn to do this stuff
yourself. And there's great

782
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:38,780
resources on YouTube and
everything else. So I think just

783
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,519
kind of figure out where you are
and what works for you. I

784
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,829
wouldn't be afraid of using a
team. But I wouldn't necessarily

785
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:46,070
say you have to use a team
either. So whatever works for

786
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,219
you, so thanks for the question.
All right, next question came

787
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:53,090
from DJ s cube. DJ s KOB.

788
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:57,889
Alban: What ej S wave? DJ skewb
dj skewb Okay,

789
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:01,159
Kevin: what's the best way to
rebrand and retain your audience.

790
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,849
Travis: Oh, well, this one,
lucky for you, DJ Scoob is

791
00:45:04,849 --> 00:45:08,389
relatively easy. We actually
have a video on our YouTube

792
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:11,179
channel that I'll link in the
show notes, where we talk about

793
00:45:11,179 --> 00:45:14,780
rebranding, what used to be five
minute Mondays to what is now

794
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,260
Podcasting, Q&A. The biggest
things you want to think through

795
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:21,050
is make sure that your audience
knows what's happening before it

796
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,079
happens. So it doesn't happen by
surprise. They're not looking

797
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,650
for, you know, five minute
Mondays in their podcast

798
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:30,409
library, and they go and it's
not there, and they don't know

799
00:45:30,409 --> 00:45:33,559
where it is or why it's missing.
And they didn't scroll down to

800
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:36,710
see Oh, there's this new podcast
called Podcasting Q&A, that I'm

801
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:39,019
happy to be subscribed to make
sure they know what's happening

802
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:43,070
ahead of time. And then when you
actually do the rebrand, make

803
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,530
sure that you're still serving
the same kind of person. So if

804
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:49,010
you start off as like a Star
Wars fan podcast, and then you

805
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:51,889
want to jump into home
gardening, it doesn't make sense

806
00:45:51,889 --> 00:45:55,909
to rebrand that because it's
built to serve a different kind

807
00:45:55,909 --> 00:45:58,309
of person, someone who's looking
for something different. And so

808
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:01,849
if you're rebranding it, like
changing the name to be, you

809
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:04,340
know, more dialed in or you want
to take your name out of it and

810
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,530
change something like, that's
totally fine. Just make sure

811
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,869
you're serving the same kind of
person. Otherwise, you're gonna

812
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:12,260
have better success, just
creating a new podcast from

813
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:16,789
scratch. Alban, we talked about
Facebook podcasts a couple times

814
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:19,789
here on the show, and we have
lots of thoughts on it. History

815
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:22,760
breeze podcast wants to know, is
there any update on Facebook

816
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,449
podcasts?

817
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:25,760
Alban: Do you actually know who
history briefs is?

818
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:26,570
Travis: I do not.

819
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,869
Alban: That's a our friend Brad
shrieve wonderful Ostuni show.

820
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,789
So if you want to hear short
stories about history, check it

821
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:39,679
out. Okay, so what's happening
with Facebook podcasts? Well, I

822
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:44,030
still am very bullish on it. I
think Facebook could open the

823
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:47,809
door to millions of new
listeners, if they ever decide

824
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:51,230
to really launch Facebook
podcasts, they announced a ton

825
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:55,309
very quickly. And then they had
a date to their was launching.

826
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:59,750
And it was only going out to
like 1% of podcasts, and only 1%

827
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,539
of Facebook iOS users in the
United States. So we're talking

828
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:09,650
like a super, super limited
quantity of people we're seeing

829
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:14,780
it. And it really hasn't
launched much more than that.

830
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:20,000
The only update I have is, you
know, we had one of our shows

831
00:47:20,269 --> 00:47:23,960
how to start a podcast in there.
And that was cool. And I we

832
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,340
played around with a little bit.
And then I saw Buzzcast got

833
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:33,440
added. And that was cool. But I
went back in recently, because I

834
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,510
got an email that said your
podcast has been added to your

835
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:40,460
Facebook page. And I went in and
there are like 80 podcasts

836
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:44,599
associated with the Buzzsprout
Facebook page. Okay, well, why

837
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:48,739
is that because some of you know
Buzzsprout hosts over 100,000

838
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:53,809
active podcasts. And a bunch of
you are doing great shows that

839
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:57,289
Facebook has found and said, Ah,
these would be great on Facebook

840
00:47:57,289 --> 00:47:59,929
podcasts, we are going to
automatically connect it to

841
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:04,849
their Facebook page. And they
have incorrectly identified that

842
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:10,130
Buzzsprout is the owner of that
podcast. And I have to imagine

843
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:14,030
the same thing is happening over
for all the other podcast hosts.

844
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,690
We didn't publish any of those
shows, obviously, because those

845
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:22,219
aren't ours to publish. And, you
know, if it was associated the

846
00:48:22,219 --> 00:48:24,650
Buzzsprout page, it wouldn't
help you grow your podcast on

847
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:29,630
Facebook anyway. So I guess I'm
just saying, I still think this

848
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:33,079
could be good. I'm looking
forward to learning more,

849
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:38,659
they've got to get a nice way to
submit shows via RSS, or to at

850
00:48:38,659 --> 00:48:42,320
least manually Connect shows
that they find to Facebook

851
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,679
pages. Because this totally
automated solution is definitely

852
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:48,889
not working now. But we saw
growing pains. In the beginning

853
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,650
of Spotify, we saw Growing Pains
like this, the beginning of

854
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:56,269
Amazon, to a much lesser extent.
And some even with beginning of

855
00:48:56,269 --> 00:49:00,650
Google podcasts. It's reasonable
that we have them. Now with

856
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:04,130
Facebook. I'm sure it'll get
cleared out. But once this

857
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:08,449
launches, and once it there's an
easy solution. Brad, you'll be

858
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:11,809
one of the first people that to
know, because I think it could

859
00:49:11,809 --> 00:49:15,289
be really big in the grand
scheme of things for podcasts.

860
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:20,269
It's gonna be huge, huge.
Facebook was very big for our

861
00:49:20,269 --> 00:49:21,590
former president. So

862
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:24,349
Kevin: that's the next big thing
is when was that platform that

863
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:24,920
got canceled?

864
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:25,760
Alban: parlor?

865
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:28,940
Kevin: parlor podcasts coming?

866
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,840
Alban: We had them for a hot
minute. Do you not work? Okay,

867
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,190
so there are two parlour apps.

868
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,519
Kevin: There was doesn't have
enough editing work to do

869
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:39,530
already. Now we're gonna go into
the parlor.

870
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:43,730
Alban: This is a segment This is
the second podcast. All right,

871
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,309
Kevin: let me fire off another
question for you. What is the

872
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:50,179
least complicated platform for
recording? I'm assuming we're

873
00:49:50,179 --> 00:49:52,880
talking about recording multiple
people remote, so let's steer it

874
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,480
in that direction.

875
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:57,380
Travis: All right, multiple
people remotes and we're gonna

876
00:49:57,409 --> 00:50:02,389
set up a basic bar of a Audio
needs to be at least average,

877
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,840
right? There's lots of solutions
for, you know, capturing phone

878
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,869
calls and things like that, but
not really the level of quality

879
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:15,440
you'd want in a podcast, if you
just want super simple and very

880
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,699
intuitive zoom, surprisingly,
can give you some good audio if

881
00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:22,340
you have all the settings tuned
correctly. So you'll want to

882
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:25,969
record separate audio files for
each participant, you'll want to

883
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:30,110
turn original audio on. So that
zoom isn't compressing the audio

884
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,500
file as it's being streamed back
and forth. And you'll want to

885
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:37,250
save it both locally to your
computer and to the cloud. At

886
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,949
the same time, if you have all
those settings turned on, and

887
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:42,650
the other person has the zoom
app download to the computer,

888
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:46,309
it's pretty intuitive. But if
you want something that is going

889
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:49,699
to give you that extra level of
quality, and the software that

890
00:50:49,699 --> 00:50:52,519
we've used for Buzzcast that we
recommend for podcasting is

891
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:56,659
Riverside, and squad cast, both
of those will give you

892
00:50:57,019 --> 00:51:00,650
completely lossless audio. So
whatever the microphone is

893
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:03,769
recording, that's what you're
going to get. And it's built

894
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,889
right into a web app. So you're
going to send someone a link,

895
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:10,070
they click it, and you can start
recording your podcast.

896
00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:11,869
Fantastic. Alright, one more.

897
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,989
Kevin: Let's do one more. And
this is a tricky one. Luckily,

898
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:18,199
we have an expert on the panel
today. Can you use small

899
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:22,760
snippets of movie audio? Or
waves when discussing a film or

900
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,300
a show?

901
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:24,349
Alban: Can you?

902
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,659
Travis: Alban, you're the
expert. You tell us?

903
00:51:27,289 --> 00:51:31,130
Alban: All right. Yeah, I guess
Kevin wants me to give my non

904
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:35,239
real this is like a fake thing.
But I am a lawyer. I'm not your

905
00:51:35,239 --> 00:51:38,719
lawyer. I wasn't even a good
lawyer, even when I was a

906
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:41,119
lawyer. So I take all that into
account.

907
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:44,989
Kevin: Why Why do people do
that? album? sidebar? legal

908
00:51:44,989 --> 00:51:49,670
term? Why? Why every time a
lawyer gives an answer on a

909
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:52,519
podcast or or TV show or
somebody that why do they say

910
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:54,230
that? What do they say I am a
lawyer, but I'm not your lawyer.

911
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:54,769
Why is that?

912
00:51:54,829 --> 00:51:59,119
Alban: Okay? So there's actually
a lot of law around whether or

913
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:05,179
not a client or attorney client
relationship is formed. And so

914
00:52:05,179 --> 00:52:07,760
sometimes people will like show
up in your office and be like,

915
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,860
blah, blah, blah, talk to you
about their case, and then be

916
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,650
like, cool, you're my lawyer.
And then you're like, No, no,

917
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:15,619
you're not my No, no, I'm not
your lawyer yet. And they're

918
00:52:15,619 --> 00:52:18,829
like, Oh, yeah, you are. And you
can actually kind of get roped

919
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:22,010
into doing some legal work,
especially if you're already

920
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:25,010
like going to trial, even if
they're not paying your bills.

921
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:29,840
all that to say, you got to make
sure that people know when

922
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:34,250
there's a attorney client
relationship formed. And I think

923
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:38,059
that it's gone a little bit too
far when people are like, I'm a

924
00:52:38,059 --> 00:52:41,000
lawyer, but not your lawyer,
like no one in their right mind

925
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,159
is thinking like this random
anime avatar lawyer on Twitter,

926
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:49,969
like re tweeting back at you is
actually their attorney. No one

927
00:52:49,969 --> 00:52:51,710
thinks that there's a
relationship there.

928
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:54,440
Kevin: So just to be clear,
Alban, you are my attorney, but

929
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,400
you're not the listeners.
Attorney. Right? I actually.

930
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:01,969
Okay, so can I use a clip from a
movie or a TV show? Can I put it

931
00:53:01,969 --> 00:53:04,909
in my podcast? And if I do that,
am I gonna get in trouble?

932
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:08,480
Alban: Alright, so the what
they're kind of hinting towards

933
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,650
is copyright law, and
specifically fair use. So if

934
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:16,309
something is copyrighted, you
can't use it in your podcast?

935
00:53:16,579 --> 00:53:20,750
Well, you can, but then you will
get sued. And then people are

936
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,300
most people are savvy enough.
They're like, but sometimes I

937
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:27,230
know that stuff is in in things.
And there's this thing called

938
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:32,269
fair use. Yeah, there is there
is a legal defense to a

939
00:53:32,269 --> 00:53:36,650
copyright suit called fair use.
And that's when you're using me

940
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:39,469
it would be like if your Do you
there's different ways you could

941
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:43,670
say we're using it for
educational purposes. I'm only

942
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,219
using this in a satirical way
I'm using it. In a way I think

943
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:52,400
that modifies the original I
forget the legal term for that.

944
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:54,980
It's been a long time since I
didn't do well on copyright law.

945
00:53:55,429 --> 00:54:00,199
But all that to say, yeah, you
can use stuff, but then you get

946
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:03,800
sued for it. And then you try to
prove to the judge that it was

947
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,489
an acceptable fair use. That's
not the situation you want to

948
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:14,030
find yourself in for your movie
podcast. What is much better is

949
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:19,309
to just talk about the podcast,
or to actually get to license

950
00:54:19,309 --> 00:54:21,829
whatever, you know, whatever
license you need to get to

951
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:25,880
actually share those clips. This
is definitely not the end.

952
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,710
Another thing to think about is
a lot of different platforms are

953
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:35,960
scanning to find content that
is, you know, violating

954
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,329
copyright, because of DMCA. So.
YouTube has bots that are

955
00:54:41,329 --> 00:54:44,659
checking every video going, Hey,
is there any Miley Cyrus music

956
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:50,000
in here, and if it is like, turn
it off, turn off this video and

957
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,309
let Miley Cyrus give you a
strike on your account. So

958
00:54:55,909 --> 00:54:58,250
that's going on in the
background for all a lot of

959
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:03,170
these channels. Spotify, YouTube
in particular, I'm sure Apple

960
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:07,130
has some as well, if you're on
any of those platforms, even if

961
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:11,329
you have the copyright, it can
get a little dicey because the

962
00:55:11,329 --> 00:55:15,139
bot picks you up says, Oh,
that's copyrighted music, turn

963
00:55:15,139 --> 00:55:17,690
it off. And then you've got to
actually work with that platform

964
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,909
to be like, no YouTube, I
actually have rights to this. I

965
00:55:19,909 --> 00:55:23,090
mean, there's so many kind of
funny examples of people

966
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:26,119
uploading their own music to
YouTube, and YouTube goes, Oh,

967
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:28,880
this is copyrighted. And they're
like, yeah, by me, I gotta turn

968
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,079
this off for a bit. So all that
to say, don't, it's not worth

969
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:38,150
the hassle. I have heard of
people who do shows that involve

970
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:42,019
a lot of music, or movie
trailers or stuff that is

971
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:46,010
copyrighted on Patreon. And they
put all of it behind the

972
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:49,940
paywall, and my only thinking is
the only people who see it are

973
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:54,619
paying subscribers. And there is
no algorithm running around

974
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:56,960
checking for copyrighted
material that is a copyright

975
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,860
violation that is just unlikely
to be caught. So wouldn't

976
00:56:00,889 --> 00:56:06,230
recommend it. But um, yeah,
don't use it. Be good. Don't do

977
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:06,920
bad things.

978
00:56:07,429 --> 00:56:10,550
Kevin: Alright, challenged to
that answer. I listened to

979
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:14,210
podcasts like Seth Rogen does
the akimbo podcast, and people

980
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,309
do it on talk radio all the
time, they play these little

981
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:20,179
clips, like whatever, you know,
a little sound from the Seinfeld

982
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:24,050
show, or a famous one liner from
friends episode or something

983
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,969
like that, just as like little
transitions where they make a

984
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:28,820
joke, and they get, you know,
they're like, you know, for

985
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,949
whatever reason, new moon or
something like that, like comes

986
00:56:30,949 --> 00:56:34,190
in, like, how do they get away
with that? And can I do

987
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,250
something like, to that extent
on my podcast without trouble,

988
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:40,070
Alban: I need to go pull it up,
Kev, I mean, you're, you're

989
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:44,449
still in your landing into Fair
Use space again. And so you

990
00:56:44,449 --> 00:56:48,019
could still end up like, I think
all of those radio stations like

991
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:51,769
some, you know, whoever owns the
rights to Seinfeld. Now, Fox

992
00:56:51,769 --> 00:56:55,159
could be like, Alright, let's go
after him for that. It's just a

993
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:59,599
big difference if like your
radio station, or you're a

994
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,170
pretty big company that actually
has a lawyer on staff that can

995
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,260
be like, Oh, I can respond to
the threatening letter. I can

996
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:10,070
respond to YouTube when they're
trying to get this taken down.

997
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:15,650
Versus I'm an individual. And
all of a sudden, I'm dealing

998
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:19,400
with this massive issue, at
least in your mind. I mean, you

999
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,389
get one cease and desist letter.
Most lawyers, like when we get

1000
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:25,670
cease and desist letters are
like, yeah, these get sent out

1001
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:28,579
all the time. And a lot of
times, there's no suit even

1002
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:33,320
coming after, after them. But if
you're an individual, and you

1003
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,079
get a cease and desist letter,
you're like, Oh, my gosh, I

1004
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,280
can't go spend 10 grand and hire
an attorney. I can't fight this.

1005
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:43,909
We're talking about a podcast
with 80 listeners. Well, as soon

1006
00:57:43,909 --> 00:57:46,610
as that happens, now, you're
going back in and re editing all

1007
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:49,309
your episodes to take out these
segments, you're taking down

1008
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:53,780
episodes. It just throws a huge
wrench into your life is like

1009
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:57,619
did that ever improve the
podcast anyway? I don't think

1010
00:57:57,619 --> 00:58:01,789
so. So that's my take on why I
would probably leave it out.

1011
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:02,840
Well, Albert, I

1012
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,869
Travis: think that's fantastic.
Official lawyer Lee advice.

1013
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,980
Kevin, are you gonna say?

1014
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,769
Kevin: Well, every now and then
this does happen. And some of

1015
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:12,889
our customers get cease and
desist letters and they get sued

1016
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:15,739
and they say like, what can you
do to help me and we can only

1017
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:18,530
have like one response, which
is, I know a lot of people want

1018
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:24,199
to send water. Just send your
cash. Alright, wrap us up.

1019
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:27,500
Travis: If you want us to do
more of these a lightning round

1020
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:31,219
Question and Answer segments,
make sure that you tell Alban on

1021
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:34,070
Twitter. that'll probably be the
fastest way to get to one of us

1022
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:36,829
and let us know that you really
liked that. We did this. That's

1023
00:58:36,829 --> 00:58:39,380
it for today. We'll get to the
next one. Keep podcasting
