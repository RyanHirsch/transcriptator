00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,060
country and Alabama. The man who

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,460

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,260
Unknown: Adam Clark curry. Yes.

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,970
Dave Jones: Don't for one day.
Party.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,460
Adam Curry: Why are you being
stern with me? You threw out an

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,070
Adam Clark curry that triggered
me right away.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,660
Dave Jones: Yeah, no, I knew it
would.

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,390
Adam Curry: David Ashley Jones.

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,150
Dave Jones: Yes. There's only
one I only have one rule and

19
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,770
then no part no part long gone.

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,030
Adam Curry: But we cleaned up.
There was only Dame DeLoreans

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,700
panties apparently around the
flagpole. Everything else was

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,060
clean. We didn't do anything.
Anything bad. I'm so sorry.

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,540
Dave Jones: It was much
entertaining.

24
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,910
Adam Curry: Oh, well. You heard
it while you're at the office

25
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,330
listening.

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,630
Dave Jones: I got a bootleg. I
got somebody sent me a bootleg.

27
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,290
Okay, I

28
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,020
Adam Curry: purposely did not
record because I didn't want any

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,660
evidence that we were breaking
the law not only breaking the

30
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,020
law by playing two and a half
hours of licensed music on the

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,010
stream, but also taking money
for it which which is, I think a

32
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,300
super violation.

33
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,040
Dave Jones: There there is there
is a bootleg if you know the

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,060
right guy down on Fifth Avenue,
behind the corner.

35
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,400
Adam Curry: Canal Street is what
you're talking about Canal

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,700
Street.

37
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,850
Dave Jones: With enough sets you
can get a you can get a bootleg

38
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,210
for those

39
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,680
Adam Curry: who are wondering
what we're talking about.

40
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,740
Yesterday, we were ready to go
for our regular regularly

41
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,250
scheduled board meeting time.
And well there were two things

42
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,580
that happen actually, I now the
hill country here in Texas had

43
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,620
had a pretty big storm. I have
Thursday, Friday and Thursday

44
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,620
and Thursday morning was really
bad with golf ball sized hail,

45
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,020
which sounded great against our
metal roof. In the morning, I

46
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,470
was crazy. I was I mean the dog
was freaked out. I have not seen

47
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,380
our dog freaked out by anything.
But this freaked her out. And

48
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:32,700
then Friday it just I mean, it
really missed Fredericksburg and

49
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,450
went right past us. Some prayer
was involved, I'm sure. But

50
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,080
Dave Jones: yes, diversionary
prayer. Yes, I forgot.

51
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,130
Adam Curry: Yes, but I forgot to
add a diversionary tactic for

52
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,020
you. And it hit pretty hard. So
So now, somewhere down the line,

53
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,020
my bandwidth was totally
crapping out my upstream was

54
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,030
about 500 kilobits per second,
which is not the typical

55
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,080
upstream. And that just as as I
was figuring that out, you know,

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,420
bringing out different access
points. I've gotten, you know,

57
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,800
I've got T Mobile Verizon, I
have, if all else fails, I've

58
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,100
got Starlink, although that does
introduce some latency. So we're

59
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,800
messing around with that. And
then Dave goes, Oh, bad signal.

60
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,590
The power went down in the
office. What happened there?

61
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,450
Dave Jones: Yeah, yeah, that's
so yeah, I guess yesterday was a

62
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,980
total cluster. I mean, like, I
got in the car, even going back

63
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,540
before what? What happened with
the show, I got in the car, to

64
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,320
leave to go to the office for
work. And I get a ping on my

65
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,400
phone. I look down at the phone
and it says, you've got a guest,

66
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,010
Mike, Michael and Sam from wave
lake at 9am. Oh, right. What?

67
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,830
None, right? No. 30. And so I
get to the office and I emailed

68
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,490
them. And I'm like,

69
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,050
Adam Curry: and they're always
there. We're sitting ready. They

70
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,580
got the headphones on everything
good.

71
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,770
Dave Jones: I was like, Hey,
guys, please tell me this was a

72
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,650
this was a timezone mix up. And
I didn't actually send you a

73
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,570
load report. And they were like,
No, you send it for nine. I was

74
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,500
like, damn it.

75
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,080
Adam Curry: How does it? How
does that happen? Because you

76
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,470
use you know, use Google use
your calendar for that.

77
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,920
Dave Jones: Now use fast mails,
calendar, but it's all through

78
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,420
the iPhone. I don't think I've
ever messed that up in in a

79
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,590
mess. I just totally boned it. I
mean, like, it was terrible. And

80
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,890
then it turned out it was it was
actually good that they didn't,

81
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,520
they didn't that we had to move
the interview because then all

82
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,350
that stuff happened with your
bandwidth and then the power

83
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,800
went off at work. And so then I
was like, I gotta go back. I

84
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,960
mean, I gotta get back to the
office now.

85
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,410
Adam Curry: Does it blip or does
it fail over nicely to the to

86
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,860
the UPS is that handle the
switch over to the generator?

87
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,180
Dave Jones: Yes, it's same. It's
seamless. But see, we have for

88
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,420
four reasons. We can't get
natural gas. We have diesel

89
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,950
generator. And so

90
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,830
Adam Curry: you are single
handedly responsible for climate

91
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,640
change right now.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,170
Dave Jones: If I was and I was I
was pouring five gallons of

93
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:08,430
climate change into the
generator with every jug less

94
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:08,550
than

95
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:12,989
Adam Curry: five gallons of
climate change coming right up.

96
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,899
That's how they should measure
it. Oh my god, yeah, pretty

97
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,589
climate change.

98
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,970
Dave Jones: And that's the so I
got like, the lightning struck

99
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,970
the power pole that feeds our
building and we have three phase

100
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,750
power. So it took one of the
lines, it was just gone. I mean,

101
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,360
like it just blew the thing off
the pole. And

102
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,209
Adam Curry: what the whole
transformer blew right off the

103
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:33,539
pole.

104
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,460
Dave Jones: There wasn't a
transformer it's like it's like

105
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,240
there's it's three phase so you
get three lines coming in in one

106
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,420
one of the connector lines that
go off the main was just gone.

107
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,810
And so the power of come they
came out

108
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,230
Adam Curry: you didn't get your
your your gear out and clamp in

109
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,640
the pole and reconnect that
thing.

110
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,210
Dave Jones: I don't I don't
know. I don't do a lot of poll

111
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:57,960
work these days.

112
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,110
Adam Curry: These days.

113
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:07,890
Dave Jones: Now now I'm on all
this. Now, because the isobar is

114
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,170
working so well now I'm just
feet. I'm trying to feed the

115
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,790
isobar as much as I can I sell

116
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,890
Adam Curry: bought is
unbelievable. I love I was just

117
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,320
telling Tina, how that works is
that how does that happen? How

118
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,260
do they even do that? It's magic
map. They have running, running

119
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,000
some kind of transcript in real
time.

120
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,400
Dave Jones: But I got home about
one o'clock in the morning.

121
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,520
Adam Curry: Oh my goodness.
Power was back on by them.

122
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,730
Dave Jones: Yeah, where they
fixed so we had to turn because

123
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,330
it wasn't actually all the way
out. It was just it was out of

124
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,710
phase. Only one of the lines was
gone. So things were like

125
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:44,490
flickering lights. were flashing
like disco tech. Yeah.

126
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,370
Adam Curry: Phasing. Oh, that's
fantastic.

127
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,940
Dave Jones: That was horrible.
It was scary. So they were like

128
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,440
yeah, we're shutting the whole
thing. We're just shutting the

129
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,950
whole Yeah, make sense. Anyway,
so did didn't want that. But it

130
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,890
was it was just a weird, man.
It's just a weird weekend so

131
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,330
far. Very strange.

132
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,660
Adam Curry: Well, I'm so hot
man. So and you and your work

133
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,840
today as well at the office? I
did. Yeah. Because he went right

134
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,090
back in at nine o'clock. No. Was
there eight? Yeah. After getting

135
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,810
home at one.

136
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,600
Dave Jones: Yeah, but I'm gonna
I'm gonna sleep really good

137
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,300
tomorrow. Okay, I'm making that
today. I'm making up for it.

138
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,510
Tonight. I took a shower, before
the show to like, wake myself up

139
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,500
getting myself fired up.

140
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,930
Adam Curry: Yeah. You're lit.

141
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,140
Dave Jones: Lit and lit. is lit
as I can

142
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,440
Adam Curry: get this show is
lit, which is the formula for

143
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,160
for success. As far as I'm
concerned. This is a live item

144
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,090
tag where if you use the
appropriate podcast app, you'll

145
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,300
actually get an alert for this
pod verse seems to be the one

146
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,480
that's doing it the best I think
podcast addict has it and don't

147
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,770
is that out of beta yet. The
podcast addict alert system.

148
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,870
Okay. And of course, Europe
curio caster. I was looking at

149
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,240
the charts yesterday. With me
spinning our tunes for two and a

150
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,760
half hours, something really
magically happened. And to me,

151
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,630
it was yeah, it happens during a
regular show, too. But there's

152
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:14,010
something about the audience
participation that just went

153
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,910
with the flow. And, you know,
because of course we have the

154
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,880
chat room when you when you use
pod verse, the chat room opens

155
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,240
up, you get the live signal. You
go into the live the live item

156
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,090
right there and your list. You
can chat along and you can boost

157
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,660
in real time. And I think was
Todd Cochran. Mr. Blueberry, he

158
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,250
started off. He's like 25,000
SATs and he wanted a song. And

159
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,210
he said right there, the next
request has to be five more. And

160
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,690
it was like, Okay, the next one
was 30,000. And then I think,

161
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,750
was Carolyn Blaney. She sent
20,000 requested something, but

162
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,710
blueberry came in and said, I'm
gonna add 15,000 to make up so

163
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,740
it's 35 for her request. And
people just do things up and up

164
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,720
and up, like 5060 70,000 SATs
and requests and I'm like, stop.

165
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,210
First of all, I was embarrassed.
Yeah. But also, I discovered

166
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:11,520
something else. When you open up
the stream to requests, you get

167
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,970
a lot of shit. It's not really
necessarily in the groove of the

168
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,260
dance party. Metallica Okay,
right? Yeah, I like Metallica

169
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,380
too. It's just, you know, and
then followed by polka music

170
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,770
from Weird Al Yankovic it was it
was a little a little hectic, it

171
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,430
was all over the spectrum. But
we had a good very reminiscent

172
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,400
Dave Jones: of FUBAR Fridays
with the Dropbox.

173
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,640
Adam Curry: Daily source code.
Exactly.

174
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,190
Dave Jones: Yeah, that was all
over the map to like some of the

175
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,200
some of those was like, okay,
yeah,

176
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,410
Adam Curry: yeah, yeah. But it
was it was really fun. And it

177
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,090
was just nice to see everyone
kind of go with the flow. And

178
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,830
that's something that we're
bringing something really

179
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,070
beautiful back that existed
many, many many years ago. I

180
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:01,080
mean, these days you even have
Okay, I should probably play

181
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07,740
this chat GPT is now doing radio
GPT they're literally pitching

182
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,960
AI voices to run your radio
station. And I got to play this

183
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,280
this little demo they have. So
as I've done a lot of top 40

184
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,440
radio work certainly in the in
the 90s, late 80s, early 90s it

185
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,990
already was very formulaic. Now
you had a lot of leeway

186
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,900
depending on who you were what
time slot you have, you know

187
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:36,150
what station, but in general,
Steve Kingston legendary program

188
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,360
director who was at GE 100 When
I was there, he would say, Hey,

189
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,890
man, and a monkey could do this.
Just read the liner cards and

190
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,690
hit the button. And literally,
that's it always ended with z

191
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,320
100.

192
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,620
Dave Jones: That's in New York,
right? Z. When

193
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,710
Adam Curry: do you want 100?
Toby? Yeah, I was brought in by

194
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,680
Scott Shannon, who's the legend
who I've you know, had probably

195
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,650
any of my radio career to thank
because I emulated him so much.

196
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:06,840
So the I all the elements that
you know, just for the regular

197
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,750
jocks I will say for you know,
except for drive time in the

198
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,770
morning, and drive time in the
afternoon. everyone kind of has

199
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,920
to follow these rules overnight.
You could break some some, some

200
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,330
rules and stuff, but now they
still the most expensive part of

201
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,840
any organization is going to be
people so screw the DJs get rid

202
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,570
of the button pushers. We don't
even need monkeys anymore.

203
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,850
Listen to this promo from radio
GPT. And by the way, everything

204
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,270

something that you are told and

205

Adam Curry: So this this drivel
and by the way, they have a

258
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,800
video of this of this AI bot she
doesn't blink and trust me to be

259
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,710
a good podcast or like me you
got to blink have to read all

260
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,830
kinds of ticks otherwise you
just no good you got to have

261
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,070
that

262
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,260
Dave Jones: most that's the
bottom bar

263
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,260
Adam Curry: is not blinking. So
this of course is atrocious. But

264
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,580
this will this will get get
radio airtime people will do

265
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,810
this. And compared to what we
had going on yesterday. It's

266
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,430
there's just no comparison that
the thing lived it live. And

267
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,060
people were feeding back in real
time. The whole thing was just a

268
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,080
beautiful experience. It was so
special about it

269
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:51,480
Dave Jones: as a DJ Yeah. I
mean, so this is this was great.

270
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:58,770
So I'm listening to the bootleg.
And, and, and it's it reminded

271
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,920
me so you weren't expecting
thing. You weren't expecting for

272
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,890
things to go in that direction?
No, I was not like better No,

273
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,680
yeah, back in the day when you
would do a daily source code and

274
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,920
things would you came in knowing
what you were getting your your

275
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,940
bad rest on,

276
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,890
Adam Curry: that allows stuff.
Yeah, good to go. Yeah.

277
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,090
Dave Jones: And so this, this,
this evolved at the first, maybe

278
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:23,040
the first 15 minutes or so 20
minutes, you're kind of like

279
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,090
understanding where this thing
was headed. About 30 minutes

280
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,490
into it, you're hitting the
groove, I'm gonna like it was.

281
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,030
And then and then an hour in,
you were just, I mean, it was

282
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,690
full, it was like it was 2004
all over again. I mean, these

283
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,410
are 2007. I mean, he's been,
you're killing it.

284
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,870
Adam Curry: The thing that was
that was weird is I, you know,

285
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,400
Spotify, the he used to have.
Spotify would allow third party

286
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,730
apps. And you could have two
songs or more even. But you

287
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,150
could have two tracks, one
playing and one queued up. So

288
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,880
while one is playing, you can
then go listen to another one.

289
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,150
But if you only have one,
Spotify app, you can't queue

290
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,870
anything up. So I was literally
like stopping it clicking on

291
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,390
something while I'm talking
clicking on the next one. And

292
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,340
then because it had to load for
a second, you know, the

293
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,310
bandwidth was kind of shitty as
well. So I was really just, you

294
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,950
know, it was very, very low bar
low tech, to do it this way. And

295
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,010
luckily, I had a couple of
tracks myself. So, you know, if

296
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,680
I was trying to queue something
up, I could, you know, do

297
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,920
something else on a different a
pre fader Listen, but it was

298
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,330
definitely not ideal from a,
from a music library standpoint,

299
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,610
it's too bad that Spotify
doesn't allow you to do that

300
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,120
anymore.

301
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,080
Dave Jones: I've never done
obviously never done any of that

302
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,410
kind of thing. So I'm imagining
that the way it goes is your the

303
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,710
the track this live is playing
and then you and then off sort

304
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:51,120
of offline or off air pre prefix
you okay, you're listening to

305
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,430
the next tried to get up to
figure out what's what is going

306
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,400
to be Yeah, and then you cute.
You're okay. That's how it goes.

307
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,370
Yeah. The fact that you couldn't
do that, and it was still as

308
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,010
smooth as it was. I mean, your
brother?

309
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,070
Adam Curry: Totally. Hey, I'm
also available for bar mitzvahs

310
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:13,020
and weddings. boosters,
boosters, boosters live. We've

311
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,490
saved yet another life. I'm very
happy to. Very happy. Yeah,

312
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,440
well. I think this person wanted
to stay anonymous. Okay, thanks

313
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,940
for opening my eyes to the pod
fasting side effects, which I

314
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,500
think is called pod speeding.
Because sound pod pod fasting

315
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,020
Dave Jones: sounds like you're
not lucky like you're listening.

316
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,800
Yes, yes.

317
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,310
Adam Curry: So my use case was
this. I tried to listen to the

318
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:43,260
show live on pod verse. But my
wife is in Germany, but my wife

319
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,480
wouldn't let me listen to the
whole show. So the next morning,

320
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,410
I would one point 25 bit to re
listen to the bits I heard, live

321
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,680
and catch up on the missed out
sections. Of course, this meant

322
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,860
that I'd be fidgety the day
after now I know why. And I

323
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,060
won't do it again.

324
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,570
Dave Jones: Thank you very much
about that. There's a delay.

325
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,840
There's your it takes you a day
to come down.

326
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,350
Adam Curry: Yes. Okay, well, how
about this? So RTP Richard

327
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,820
Peterson, key cop something when
you and I were discussing this,

328
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,320
and it really blew my mind I
have to set it up. So when we

329
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,980
were talking about you know that
this stuff can hijack your

330
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,550
nervous system and makes you
impatient with the people you

331
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,260
around you who you love or nip
the office or your kids. It

332
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,190
conditions you to accept fake
people like that radio GPT lady,

333
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,820
you know, there's a whole bunch
of downsides to it. And you said

334
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,040
that, you know, you had heard me
bitching about this several

335
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,570
years ago. And and you stopped
doing it and you notice that

336
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,390
immediately you or not like a
day or two later you had more

337
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,940
patience, right? Am I my
recounting that correctly?

338
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,430
Dave Jones: Yeah, it took a
couple of days it took two three

339
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,480
days and then I realized that
everything felt more right and

340
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,140
like everything just felt
normal. And like like as far as

341
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,230
listening to the speak because I
was so used to I've been

342
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:07,020
listening to you guys for years
on fast speed and it took it

343
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:12,840
took two or three days for me to
get used to not hearing you like

344
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,860
that. But then it's like is as
soon as my mind adjusted to it,

345
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,580
everything else fell into place
to own on like in the world.

346
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,960
Adam Curry: So one of the things
you would use is the silence

347
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,860
chopper. From Yes, so now listen
to that podcast. So this is last

348
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:38,310
week's board meeting the minute
you start talking about the sped

349
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:44,370
up chopped silences you actually
start talking fast. Listen to it

350
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,410
as a as a reformed

351
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,270
Dave Jones: podcast, multi multi
multi XOR I don't know what you

352
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,170
call that multispeed person
sick. Yeah. Yeah, as a

353
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,320
Unknown: form, sicko. Yeah,

354
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,920
Dave Jones: I used I used to
listen to All my podcasts in one

355
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,680
at one point I speed up speed up
with the with the whatever

356
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,380
whatever that thing is where
chops out the silences between

357
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,190
them and all that kind of stuff.

358
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,990
Adam Curry: Yeah, the silence
chopper. Did you hear what you

359
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,330
just did there? Yeah, I started

360
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,730
Dave Jones: as I just went, boom

361
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,380
Adam Curry: a little bit. Yeah.
And then and then right after

362
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,480
that you slow down again listen,
listen,

363
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:23,849
Dave Jones: whatever, whatever
that thing is where chops out

364
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,829
the silences between them and
all that kind of stuff. Yeah,

365
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:29,669
the silence chopper. Silence Joe
Yeah. And then.

366
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,820
Adam Curry: And then you go back
to normal speed. I think that

367
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,420
it's still in you. The
programming is still there. You

368
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,120
need you need an exorcism, I
believe I believe

369
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,410
Dave Jones: it's a virus

370
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:52,200
Adam Curry: you're cured, you're
healed. Thank you for that.

371
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,220
Fantastic observation.

372
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,350
Dave Jones: This is a good
observation because I'm

373
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,330
naturally sort of a stammer
because I try to get my brain

374
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:09,300
goes faster than my mouth. So I
have to get them in sync. And if

375
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,130
I I do this, the way I talk on
the show is exactly the way I

376
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,330
talk to people in all around me
all the time. And I realize that

377
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,960
it frustrates them. And so I
tried to talk slower, but then

378
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,440
if it could, because when I talk
fast, my stammering gets way

379
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,770
worse. It's not stuttering. It's
not like that Nina is not like

380
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,480
that, is because I start a
sentence. Realize it realize

381
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,050
that that's not the right way to
start it and then go back and

382
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,770
sometimes I'll start a sentence
three times in a row. And it

383
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:44,850
drives Melissa crazy. So like,
the faster I get it becomes just

384
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,160
like it turns into mush.

385
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,550
Adam Curry: Oh, that's
interesting. Well, actually, I

386
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:55,590
find the way you talk very
engaging I in fact, I enjoy it.

387
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,860
Believe me if I didn't like it,
I would be fuck this thing. I'm

388
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:04,260
not gonna this board meeting for
two hours. But I enjoy

389
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:09,750
personally. I like flaws. I like
it when people except the

390
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,270
president, the president, he has
no brains left. I mean, that's

391
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,530
different. What he's what he's
got going on there. But I like

392
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,540
Cridland has also has a stammer.
And it's quite endearing. He is

393
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:27,810
M's and ELLs. And I like it. I
like that kind of stuff.

394
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,990
Dave Jones: I like the humanity
of it in Yeah. Oh, yeah. It

395
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,230
makes

396
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,650
Adam Curry: you human. It's the
exact opposite of the robo jock.

397
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,560
Dave Jones: That's yeah, that
shakes said nothing wrong.

398
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,550
Adam Curry: Right. There's
nothing wrong, nothing unique.

399
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,780
Nothing interesting. Nothing
that makes you and certainly the

400
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,200
writing was inhumane. I mean,
you know, it's like, this stuff,

401
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,240
in my opinion, all that those
little nuances will never work.

402
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,350
Unless, you know, people start
tricking themselves by listening

403
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:03,360
to roboticized speech to begin
with, which is what pod speeding

404
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,100
is. Your

405
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,550
Dave Jones: I immediately I
immediately heard the problem

406
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:13,800
with that. You know, AI bots?
Yeah, the DJ no fake DJ vanilla.

407
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:23,910
Yeah, it's funny how it like,
have you seen the AR RT stuff?

408
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:28,740
And it always messes up the
hands? Yes. Like the floors look

409
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,820
like they're look like a bunch
of chopsticks by the way yeah,

410
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,100
that's there's something about
you sound like

411
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,200
Adam Curry: she sounded like
that. But like chopstick

412
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:45,600
fingers, yeah, sounds like, this
is the value for value podcast.

413
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,900
For those who need an
explanation. We have a whole

414
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,890
website for IT value number four
value dot info. But the whole

415
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,820
concept is, we give you value,
which is free for anyone to

416
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,600
receive. Because of course, we
can charge what we want and make

417
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,920
it set up behind a paywall or
make it to premium content only.

418
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,040
But only you can determine what
something's worth to you. And

419
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,970
maybe a lot of money is 50 cents
or $5 a month or a week or

420
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,540
whatever. And maybe $500 is what
it's worth to you because of

421
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,900
some incredible tip that we gave
you or we made you feel good or

422
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,380
made you laugh or made you feel
human, you get to determine that

423
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,500
and send it back to us. And we
prefer if you do it in a modern

424
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,250
podcast app, podcast apps.com is
where you can find a whole bunch

425
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,550
of someone who had an since we
have so many apps and services

426
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:38,730
now using the podcast index, and
the API associated with it that

427
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,720
we should probably put the edge
that actually forward you to

428
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,710
podcast index.org/apps We should
probably only put apps there now

429
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,330
and then and make a new section
for all the different hosting

430
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,390
companies and services. Which
probably Yeah, I agree with

431
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,330
Dave Jones: that because you
just like you go to podcast

432
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,370
apps.com And you see Buzzsprout

433
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,660
Adam Curry: Yeah, Is that
someone something anyone can do

434
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,630
with? With a, with a pull
request? That'd be great. That'd

435
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,690
be great. If we can get those
TPS reports done by tomorrow,

436
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:14,790
that'd be great. Just ask me,
that's real value there. We

437
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,610
would appreciate if someone did
that as value for value that is

438
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,130
valid. valid value.

439
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,970
Dave Jones: The comments, the
cross out comments work on the

440
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:32,730
website continues. Yeah. And
gourmet. Nathan, John, they're

441
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,890
continuing, you know, they're
just chipping away at this

442
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:39,000
thing. And I was was going to
get the latest pull request out

443
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,700
today into production, but I
didn't get a chance to but there

444
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,550
I mean, that they're continuing
to do I think they may have

445
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:49,950
their eyes set on posting, like
feedback like replies.

446
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,510
Adam Curry: Oh, okay. Oh, right.
From the right from the website.

447
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:58,019
Dave Jones: Yeah, yeah. And so
the changelog podcast guys got

448
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:02,939
in there. And we're pitching in
to on Oh, cool, awesome stuff.

449
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:05,759
So yeah, I mean, it's, it's
going somewhere. There's this a

450
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,539
team effort, the website being
open source is fantastic. Number

451
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,699
one, because you don't have the
amount of

452
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,950
Adam Curry: time to time.

453
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,240
Dave Jones: Yeah, you know, it's
funny, it's funny, not being a

454
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,630
JavaScript guy. I learned all
the horrible things about

455
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,540
JavaScript after the fact. So
these are all new to me. Yeah.

456
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:29,370
And and I say, Oh, my God date
is zero indexed on the month and

457
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,330
everyone's like, Oh, yeah, you
can tell the funding this years

458
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,020
to life,

459
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,590
Adam Curry: as well. So since
you mentioned that, I have, I

460
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:42,720
have a comment about the
integration of get Alby and

461
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,900
websites. So the experience is
as follows. And I noticed this,

462
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:53,790
it really hit me when I used pod
verse on the web, the web

463
00:26:53,790 --> 00:27:00,360
version. Here's the experience.
So you have your your wallet

464
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,800
connected, or you're using the
lb extension. So let's take

465
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,300
podcast index.org as an example.
And there's a beautiful box and

466
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,840
you type it all in and you hit
go with the number. And then

467
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,540
I'll be if you're not already
authorized, I'll be able to go

468
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,500
through that process. And then
it pops up and it says, pay this

469
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,450
amount to this person, sit,
create a budget. You know,

470
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:29,250
always remember, this was all
these options, because it has to

471
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,790
go through the splits, it does
each one independently. And if

472
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,310
you don't know what you're
doing, if you don't say you do

473
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,660
this, then it spits back every
single time. It's like people

474
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,540
you don't know it's very
confusing. And the whole budget

475
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,800
thing it's like, what we need is
an explanation. And the same

476
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,950
goes for when you do it with POD
verse on the web. So get Albie,

477
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,370
because I got a very nice boost
today. But it didn't go through

478
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,240
the splits. And I know why.
Because it was just a user I'd

479
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,170
get Alby and they're using the
extension popped it up curry in

480
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,020
the keeper, boom, and then
whatever else happened that just

481
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:09,690
dumped out. So we've that has to
be and I understand why from the

482
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,810
get Alby side, I understand, but
that has to be looked at so

483
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,470
maybe Bumi. And the guys can can
take a look at just making it a

484
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,840
little more clear. You know,
what is a budget? Why do I need

485
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,600
a budget? Do I want a budget?
Why do I have to remember this

486
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,260
for the rest? You know, just it
needs? We need some explanation

487
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,440
there. Just some words that
explain to people what's

488
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,100
happening.

489
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,980
Dave Jones: Yeah, I've noticed
that too. And I've kind of

490
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,480
forgotten about it. Yeah.

491
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,360
Adam Curry: I have Trillium.

492
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,300
Dave Jones: Oh, yeah, that thing
you're you're

493
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,080
Adam Curry: organizing. Yes. My
second brain. Exactly. Yeah,

494
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,050
Dave Jones: admit, to bring that
up a few times. Because it runs

495
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,810
you through. It's like, okay,
sand, sand, sand. Sand is it

496
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,160
runs through every one of those.
Yeah,

497
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,910
Adam Curry: and we know what's
happening. But mere mortals and

498
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:57,210
then we're not talking the
podcast, mere mortals will have

499
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:01,680
an issue. So that will be
something that that we could

500
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,160
work on.

501
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,660
Dave Jones: Let me throw let me
throw this at you. Maybe at a

502
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,240
left field here or it may not be
I don't know where your where

503
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,150
your minds at but what do you
think about the Spreaker thing

504
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,730
going free? Did you see that?
Yeah.

505
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,380
Adam Curry: I think it's a bit
of a red herring. Because it's

506
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,340
not entirely free. Yes, storage
may be free. But there are still

507
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,760
different tiers. It's kind of a
thing. It's a little bit of a

508
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,660
bait and switch.

509
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:30,539
Dave Jones: Okay, you may you
sound like you know more about

510
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,329
this than me because I tried to
figure out what they meant and I

511
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:36,719
couldn't make their press
release make sense. I went

512
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,420
Adam Curry: to the source I went
to the guru Todd Cochran.

513
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,860
Cochran told me now this is bait
and switch, they've got they've

514
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,280
got they still have different
levels and you don't get

515
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,050
everything. It is definitely a
nice offering. To me. It's a

516
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:56,460
Hail Mary. It's like what are we
going to do now? This is I heart

517
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,620
I believe, right? Do they own
Spreaker?

518
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,920
Dave Jones: Yes, and I've got
So, I would like to dig in on

519
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,530
that, after you say this,
because I've got some, I've got

520
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,490
some art stuff.

521
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:12,150
Adam Curry: Oh, good. It seems
like some Todd didn't seem

522
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,620
overly concerned about it. I'm
very concerned in general,

523
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,750
because I just don't believe in
free. Because there is no such

524
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,140
thing as free. And you're gonna
get screwed somewhere down the

525
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,970
line. If anything by by getting
the rug pulled from under you, I

526
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:35,460
don't like it because I know how
much goes into running a good

527
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,570
host and the I don't know much
about Spreaker I believe back in

528
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:44,580
the early days, Spreaker was
caching the content early, early

529
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,580
days long time, I may be wrong,
but that was Stitcher. I'm

530
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:53,190
sorry, write your stitches, a
scrap that I know what goes into

531
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,460
making a hosting company work,
especially with customer

532
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:02,190
service. And I want all of our,
all of the hosting companies to

533
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,180
prosper, and I want them to be
able to, to, you know, to

534
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,910
provide good customer service
and good service in general at a

535
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:14,040
fair price. And something like
this comes along. And you know,

536
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,640
it's kind of like anchor so it
may also pollute, you know, just

537
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,190
get a lot of pollution out
there, I think is probably to

538
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:25,050
jack up their numbers. Look how
many podcasts we've got. So I

539
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,360
did I just don't hold them in
high regard for doing this. And

540
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:35,190
it just doesn't seem like I
mean, I feel and then I'd love

541
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,850
to hear what about the I heart
stuff, I feel personally that

542
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:45,390
there should be a way for
podcast host to bring people on

543
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:49,710
at a quid pro quo of value for
value. It's like, we're gonna

544
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:54,330
take 20% Split until a certain
amount, or whatever, if you want

545
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,690
to pay, you know, you can pay
instead of doing that it's all

546
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,600
enabled right out of the gate.
Something like that, I think

547
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,570
would be a great offering. And I
think that people would pick up

548
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,300
on it. And I think that you'd
probably make more than 20 bucks

549
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,210
a month that you that you do
normally from these podcasts. So

550
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,100
it would be a net win in my
mind.

551
00:32:11,699 --> 00:32:14,249
Dave Jones: Well, that's the
only way I can make this make

552
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:19,679
sense. And this is before I've
fully understood that it wasn't

553
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,779
free across the board. Because I
was thinking at first I was

554
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,269
thinking, Oh, this is a Charles
Schwab type deal. You know what

555
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:29,339
I mean? Where they? Schwab was
about three years ago, dropped

556
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:31,259
their commission fees on trades.
Oh, yeah.

557
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,750
Adam Curry: And everyone
dropped? Yeah, everybody had to

558
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,500
drop it. Yeah.

559
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,080
Dave Jones: And so I thought it
was free across the board. But

560
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,320
this is a little it changes a
little bit. But I still I still

561
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,050
think some of this may apply.
Maybe they are looking out and

562
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:50,130
they know something ever, I
think, at least on our show me

563
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:54,270
and you both believe that anchor
isn't going to last forever.

564
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,360
It's going to fold at some
point. It's too much of an

565
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,470
albatross around around Spotify
neck. And that's completely

566
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:07,890
free. Maybe the the ease of use
of the of the anchor app and all

567
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,470
that stuff was you know, the
thing that made it a train

568
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,490
wreck. I mean, maybe they just
think that their ad dai ad

569
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,910
offering is enough to make up
the difference of all this. You

570
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:18,180
know,

571
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:23,010
Adam Curry: what, how about that
maybe? Good point. Maybe they're

572
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:26,460
thinking, Hey, as long as we get
enough people, jump folks with

573
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,580
with a with a podcast feed will
actually be able to fulfill the

574
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,300
inventory.

575
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,429
Dave Jones: Yeah, that's what
I'm thinking. Yeah,

576
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,960
Adam Curry: that makes sense.
That makes sense.

577
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:35,789
Dave Jones: Okay, well, that
leads me into this. I brought

578
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:43,529
some clips. Do you have my
clips? I do. The lets you know,

579
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:49,709
there was some talk about Marcos
discussion on I guess it was

580
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:53,489
MacBreak. Weekly, which I did
not watch. Yeah, I didn't watch

581
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:57,239
it initially. And then I and
then I did and it, you know,

582
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:59,759
it's fine. I had, I really
didn't have much of a problem

583
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:02,189
with I think there was some
misunderstanding with chapters.

584
00:34:02,189 --> 00:34:05,219
But other than that, I mean,
basically, Marco at least he

585
00:34:05,219 --> 00:34:07,439
basically just said, I don't
want people telling me what to

586
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:07,799
do.

587
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,010
Adam Curry: And you know, I hear
you. I don't want people telling

588
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:11,880
me what to do either.

589
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,720
Dave Jones: I don't either. And
so I'm like, Okay, I mean, I

590
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,490
really wasn't bothered by
anything that he said. But the

591
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,040
more interesting part of their
conversation that was about

592
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:30,270
advertising, and the display,
Lea one ad market is life

593
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:30,750
threatening.

594
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:32,759
Unknown: We're going through I
don't know about you, Marco and

595
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:35,489
I don't know, we've heard from
other podcasters. We're going

596
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:40,139
through an advertising downturn
that is existential, it's life

597
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:40,469
threatening.

598
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:45,239
Oh, yeah. It's not that bad for
our show. But it's, it's this is

599
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,939
the worst ad market we've seen
in probably a few years. Yeah.

600
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:53,730
Adam Curry: Yeah. Well, that is
only accentuated by NPR, who say

601
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:57,480
they have a $30 million deficit
and it's pretty much from the

602
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,770
podcasting department.

603
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,750
Dave Jones: Yeah, not So I think
there's a clearly there's shows

604
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,630
out there that are doing they're
doing just fine. And as the

605
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:12,150
Independence shows they have
kept their in markets that

606
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,430
they're doing. They're doing
okay. That mean they're not

607
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,570
doing great but they're doing if
I

608
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,870
Adam Curry: may, and I don't
know much about it but but what

609
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:22,680
I know from the past with AD
markets, if you have a brides

610
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,390
magazine, you're always going to
get DJs venues dressmakers, and

611
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,480
and you know this this was the
PC Magazine, you know, back in

612
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,510
the day, you know, you're gonna
get Dell and HP and everyone's

613
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,370
gonna advertise because it's
just kind of built into their

614
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:40,500
budget. If you're a general
program, a general podcast, and

615
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:47,910
you're looking for BMW and and
and T Mobile, etc. Get that's

616
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:53,040
where you're gonna get cut. So a
specialist tech podcast or we

617
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,970
like a Bitcoin podcast, I'm sure
there may be some some pullback

618
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,700
on the on the overall numbers.
But that's pretty much what

619
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,890
you're, you're still going to
get that it may even involve

620
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,190
more host reads I don't think
that the dynamic inserted ad

621
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,130
market is probably the is really
being affected. But apparently,

622
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:15,030
even in Leo's network, he says
existential. I think that's

623
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,700
because he just has too many
people too many shows. And as we

624
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,760
all know, you can't you can't
monetize the network. If it's

625
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,250
just twit itself. I'm sure
that's doing fine. I'm sure

626
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,730
security now is doing okay. But
everything else yeah, it may

627
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,890
just be a pullback, because just
too much

628
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,450
Unknown: play Lea to it. This is
normal. This is normal behavior.

629
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,900
And when you're at the bottom of
the down, it might feel like the

630
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,660
world's never going to come
back. But it will eventually.

631
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,620
Good tell that to my AD team.
Okay. Actually, we have a we

632
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,100
have an unusual problem, because
foolishly we built something

633
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,760
that has high overhead. Yeah.
And I mean, we have a two and a

634
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,040
half million dollar a year. Not.
So we don't have the luxury of

635
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,800
saying, well, if advertising,
Stan will just weather it and go

636
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,410
through it. Thank goodness that
we did do that. And I think

637
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,190
everybody who's in podcasting,
for real understands that the

638
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,130
only thing that keeps podcasting
and live as the community, the

639
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,190
listeners, the people who you
have a relationship, direct

640
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,490
relationship with, and clubs,
Patreon, that kind of thing

641
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,330
really give not only give you
that little extra income, but

642
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,300
they make a big difference in
bonding the audience to you. So

643
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,360
we two years ago, we created
club twit, and that was that was

644
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:29,490
a huge part of it. But it's
still I mean, it's still 1/10 of

645
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,000
1% or something, maybe it's I
would love if I get 5% of the

646
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,880
audience to subscribe, we
wouldn't need advertisers. But

647
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,550
right now it's not even 1% Most
people will getting something

648
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,470
for free aren't gonna start
suddenly paying for it, I'm

649
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:40,830
afraid.

650
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:46,109
Adam Curry: I'm afraid you're
wrong. I'm afraid you're wrong.

651
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:49,649
Dave Jones: You know, clearly
he's wrong. But that that is

652
00:37:50,189 --> 00:37:53,519
that speaks to what you're
saying these in specific shows

653
00:37:53,549 --> 00:37:56,249
are going to do okay, can't
monetize the network. But they

654
00:37:56,249 --> 00:38:01,409
these middle sort of middle
weight columns like a I don't

655
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:04,589
know the term middle weight
where this kind of like a fat

656
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:09,479
over hedge, you know, network or
show with those dread ads? Yes,

657
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:10,589
you're in trouble. Yeah.

658
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:15,720
Adam Curry: It's also I'm sorry,
podcasting. The only reason it

659
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,740
works. I have one example. Well,
actually, this podcast was a

660
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,590
great example. But it's slightly
different because we have a

661
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:26,760
project attached to it. So we do
have a specific ask for specific

662
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,950
thing. But without the podcast,
believe me, we wouldn't be

663
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:36,690
getting anywhere near what we're
what we're getting now. But no

664
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:41,250
agenda is the example. And you'd
have to keep asking, we ask

665
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,010
everybody we had a newsletter
before the night before the

666
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,420
show. We had the newsletter has
content in it, but we it's

667
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:56,490
definitely a an ask. The
overhead is incredibly low. And

668
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:00,720
that is partially because of the
we've we've followed the whole

669
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,660
model all the way through time,
talent, treasure. So voyage zero

670
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,260
mark up in the northern part of
the Netherlands for almost 13

671
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,020
years, maybe longer. He's been
running our infrastructure,

672
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,260
keeping that overhead incredibly
low. Considering the amount of

673
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,490
bandwidth we push. Every website
was built by someone else who

674
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:24,420
just jumped in to help. And we
acknowledge them and give them

675
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,080
credit for it. And they give him
props. And by the way, they they

676
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,380
sometimes put a little donate
thing on their own work for

677
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,490
that, which we're fine with. So
keeping that this that show was

678
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:39,210
run out of the vortex top
drawer, basically, you know, I

679
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,970
do all the production stuff. He
handles all the money stuff.

680
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,150
Now, we we of course we have an
accountant and you know, we do

681
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:48,690
have to pay a little extra and
they're, you know, someone puts

682
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,910
together the spreadsheet. It's
from his family, so we're

683
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,700
getting pretty cheap labor
there. But that's only because

684
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,330
it really grew out of just too
much for us to handle In

685
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:00,240
addition, but we've kept the
overhead just it's us It's

686
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,130
actually and, again, time
talent, treasure. I have three

687
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,600
four people who reliably,
reliably send me clips that are

688
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,200
perfectly produced and we credit
them for it. In fact, the clip

689
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,070
custodian is in the value for
value split gets a split. He

690
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:22,140
does, yes. Jeff Smith, who has
created all of our sound imaging

691
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,140
and whenever we say she, we need
jingle for that just miss shows

692
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:29,370
up. You're not gonna send us a
bill, the art. Now not all of

693
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,680
the audit, we changed the art
for every single show. Not all

694
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,550
the artists have a wallet. I've
encouraged them to get one. The

695
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,510
winning artists whose art is
huge in the show gets a split. I

696
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,690
wish

697
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,460
Dave Jones: people would send
art for our show. Just say.

698
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:46,769
Adam Curry: Yeah, we'll be fine.
The overhead low is incredibly

699
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:49,049
important. And this is what
Spotify screwed up.

700
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,690
Dave Jones: Well, this is
affecting I want to I want to

701
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,060
throw a curveball at you in a
second. But I gotta set it up.

702
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,340
Okay, I gotta set it up. And
then I'm gonna I'm gonna

703
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,340
curveball the spit ball at you.
It's gonna be a breaker.

704
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,110
Adam Curry: All right. My bad is
quarks. I'm ready.

705
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:09,420
Dave Jones: Okay, the. So I
think this is also affecting,

706
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:14,070
it's affecting the big guys too.
But they've been able to do

707
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,800
something that the middleweight
mass, say the big guys, I mean,

708
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,910
like our heart and the big the
big players, the big ones. So

709
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:25,770
they have tactics that the small
guys don't have, or the smaller

710
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:31,440
guys don't have. So this is a
interview on decoder with Conal

711
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,190
Byrne, the CEO of ahart,
digital. And so I heard is split

712
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:38,850
into sort of two components.
They're split into their digital

713
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:41,520
audio group and the multi
platform group. The digital

714
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,520
audio group has podcasts, the
multi platform group has

715
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:50,640
broadcast radio, and in turn,
sort of traditional broadcast.

716
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,350
So play 101, how you hide the
numbers,

717
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:59,550
Unknown: we felt at I heart that
a lot of the value that we had

718
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:05,130
as a company, we wanted to
unlock and make more transparent

719
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:10,530
to the investor community, to
audiences, to researchers to

720
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:14,880
analysts. One way to do that is
to create different operating

721
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,270
segments in your company so that
you can talk more about how well

722
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,300
you're doing inside certain
divisions and businesses, as

723
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:25,590
opposed to it all getting lumped
together into one big overall

724
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,550
set of numbers.

725
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:31,229
Adam Curry: Right, which Spotify
doesn't do very well actually

726
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:31,619
read.

727
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,050
Dave Jones: They're not very
good. So when I say hide the

728
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,850
numbers, I don't mean that like
they're doing anything

729
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,550
nefarious, because all companies
do this. It's just normal. No,

730
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:38,670
they're

731
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,400
Adam Curry: just trying to
trying to show the Wall Street.

732
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,640
Dave Jones: Yeah, yeah, this is
this. This is just normal. But

733
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:49,200
but the smaller, the smaller
groups that can't do this sort

734
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:55,080
of financial trickery. But the
so if you look at there's a

735
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:59,190
document in there with the I
heart financials that you may

736
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,640
want to look at, yeah, I got it.
I mean, look at this. I'm

737
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,490
looking at I'm looking at
accountant here. You're like

738
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:09,270
Adam Curry: a stock guru. This
is like DHL plugged all of a

739
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:13,980
sudden, okay. I'm looking at a
revenue stream in a table. My

740
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,940
eyes are swimming.

741
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,820
Dave Jones: All right. Yeah. So
the I'm thinking that the

742
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:25,770
middleweights? Well, let's just
look at our heart thing. So they

743
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:33,900
said they say on here that they
grew in their, in their podcast

744
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,700
group, they, it says that they
grew 44.3% for the three months

745
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:45,660
ended December 22. December
2022. Year, in your footnote,

746
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:55,200
though, correct. In says, it
says this, absent excluding

747
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,240
political revenue, ah, it was
only six and a half percent,

748
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,570
right. It was an election year.
It was an election year and 22.

749
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,570
Adam Curry: Yeah. Which is
billions of dollars billions of

750
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:07,200
dollars.

751
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,230
Dave Jones: The same thing with
broadcast broadcast that it grew

752
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,710
point 9% in the third quarter
and the fourth quarter, it

753
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:16,890
actually seemed to exclude
political ad revenue. It was a

754
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:21,090
loss of 2.8% Yeah, you go in
it's the same thing for the hope

755
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:25,080
for the full year. The full year
goes from a 22% growth and

756
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,300
podcast revenue to only a 5%.
The

757
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,330
Adam Curry: beauty of political
ads is they don't give a crap

758
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,480
they don't care what you're on
the more crazy you are the

759
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:33,960
better

760
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,100
Dave Jones: and they blast it
across everything. They let do

761
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:43,200
like the most broad spectrum by
good catch. So this to me what

762
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,710
what was what was bothering me
or a little weird was why 2022

763
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:52,740
was a very hard financial
economic year. But the

764
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,620
advertising wasn't as down as
much as you thought it was. A

765
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,530
bit of money came in for the
cause of the political

766
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:01,680
advertising but then at 23 Now
you're starting to see the pain.

767
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,280
Yeah, like the first quarter of
23 has been brutal. And that

768
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:11,820
that's where I think that this
may, this may explain Springer's

769
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,630
move here. Because being being
part of I Heart, they may be

770
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,320
feeling feeling the hit. And
they may this may be a push

771
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:23,910
across the entire company
eventually to go full in dai

772
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:29,700
dynamic ad insertion. And if
that happens, those done, the

773
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:34,200
more inventory space you push
onto the market, it's going to

774
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,830
push those CPM rates way down.
Oh, yeah, you're just gonna have

775
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:41,400
too much, you're gonna have too
much ad space to be filled. And

776
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,860
that's going to affect that's
going to drive everything down

777
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,360
for everybody across the board.
I think this the Latin the fact

778
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,350
that the last year was a
political year and going into

779
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:55,710
2023. This could be bad, though.
It's

780
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:58,109
Adam Curry: bad. It's guaranteed
to be bad

781
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:01,409
Dave Jones: on because everybody
thinks da everybody thinks oh,

782
00:46:01,919 --> 00:46:05,399
listening to leet Leo,
everybody's like, Oh, well

783
00:46:06,089 --> 00:46:10,289
spoke, you know, the baked in
ads, the host reads, those are

784
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:14,759
struggling right now. But Dai is
where that's okay. But I'm

785
00:46:14,759 --> 00:46:18,389
thinking the AI is about to take
a hit to

786
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,259
Adam Curry: I think it was about
$13 billion spent political

787
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:26,129
advertising and all medium.
That's a lot of money. It's a

788
00:46:26,129 --> 00:46:31,559
crapload of money. It Yeah. And
but yeah, that's why you know,

789
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:35,429
all the numbers, you know,
they're down. You know, like,

790
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:38,969
revenue numbers. What I hear is
like, 23% growth in the first

791
00:46:38,969 --> 00:46:41,369
quarter, and then you know, six.

792
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,730
Dave Jones: Yeah, I think so
this, the Spreaker thing feels

793
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:52,440
like if they if they actually
have enough people take them up

794
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,150
on up on this offer. And it's
all based on Dai. This could end

795
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:00,600
up being a pretty bad thing
across the across the industry.

796
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,120
Oh, it's gonna suck. This is
what everybody doesn't

797
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,590
understand that dai the more the
more people you have the sign up

798
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:12,150
for Dai, the lower the CPMs. Get
for everybody.

799
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,840
Adam Curry: Also. Yeah. And I
think the CPMs of the inserted

800
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:21,180
ads are quite low. Actually.
They're probably in the 8% 10%.

801
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:25,470
I'm just spouting because I
don't really know. I did enjoy

802
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:31,020
something Cridland posted on the
podcast index dot social. It was

803
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:35,730
a screenshot of some, I guess
tweet and it was a tweet or

804
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,140
remastered on doesn't matter.
Podcasts are the new am talk

805
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,140
radio. Have you heard the ads on
am talk radio, which like

806
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,670
reading your junk folder. And,
and that's true. And you know,

807
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,150
it's ad load really is just, you
know, putting as much in as

808
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:53,250
possible so they can actually
pay the bills.

809
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:57,360
Dave Jones: This this Conal
Byrne guy. Yeah, he actually had

810
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:00,690
this play a heart too, because
he adds something that I think

811
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:01,650
is relevant to this,

812
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,750
Unknown: there was a moment on
YouTube, where we all sort of

813
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,720
realized the same thing around
like, 2010 or so there's like,

814
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,390
no, the optimal video is this
length, and you have to open

815
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:12,390
with this kind of thing, and
then close it with that. And to

816
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,960
some extent, you kill creativity
and true innovation when you

817
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,360
start to reverse engineer what
an asset should be for the

818
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,600
content platform that it's going
to be distributed on. In fact,

819
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,410
you almost certainly kill, I
think, true creativity when you

820
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:29,280
hit that moment. Podcasting,
just as a side questions, not

821
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,100
your question, but as a side
answer to it real quick.

822
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:37,350
Podcasting has bucked that a
lot. To date. It has resisted

823
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:42,270
this notion of a podcast episode
is supposed to be 28 minutes

824
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:45,810
long and have to add brakes.
It's actually a lot of different

825
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:50,220
kinds of things. It can be a
true crime limited series of

826
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:53,220
eight to 10 episodes that are 30
minutes long. It can also be

827
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,730
Stuff to Blow Your Mind episode
that sometimes three hours long

828
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:59,760
of just two guys talking about
stuff. And both are completely

829
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,170
okay, and really perform well,
actually. So it hasn't yet hit

830
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,570
this moment of reverse
engineering from the platforms

831
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:07,410
that it's on.

832
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:12,090
Adam Curry: Now, where was this?
It was just part of that

833
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,100
hodgepodge thing. Yeah, it

834
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,750
Dave Jones: was Yeah. Because it
was

835
00:49:15,749 --> 00:49:17,729
Adam Curry: really interesting.
I read a what I thought was a

836
00:49:17,729 --> 00:49:25,049
very honest rundown from the
Hollywood Reporter. And it

837
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:31,469
really explained, you know, this
hot pod Summit. I'll read just a

838
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:35,129
couple pieces here from this
article, which to me was like,

839
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:36,839
you know, the Hollywood Reporter
is going to give you the

840
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:39,239
Hollywood angle, which means
it's all about the money. That's

841
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:42,839
it's always all about the money
in various conversation with

842
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,539
studio executives and creators a
common refrain with the

843
00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:49,019
difficulties of turning a profit
on podcasting alone, even

844
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:52,019
Spotify, which recently
revisited its podcast leadership

845
00:49:52,049 --> 00:49:55,379
again, and had layoffs and show
cancellations in his podcast

846
00:49:55,379 --> 00:49:58,649
division is reevaluating its
spending after pouring more than

847
00:49:58,649 --> 00:50:01,469
$1 billion into licensing deals
with acquisitions in the past

848
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:06,719
few years. As such, repackaging
audio content and seeking out

849
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:11,339
derivatives like film and TV
adaptations could be the key to

850
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:15,119
actually making good money in
podcasting, especially now that

851
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,809
the mega deals of recent years
are getting rare. And podcasters

852
00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:21,899
are feeling the pressure to seek
out more ad dollars from bigger

853
00:50:21,899 --> 00:50:25,769
buyers to keep the lights on
long term. And all of this isn't

854
00:50:25,769 --> 00:50:28,709
even to acknowledge the creative
ambitions around podcasting,

855
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:32,219
where creators want to produce
expensive, Buzzy narrative

856
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:35,579
projects that can have a
tangible impact on policy or

857
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:38,609
public conversation, but may
have a harder time receiving

858
00:50:38,609 --> 00:50:41,939
funding and support compared to
the more assured success of

859
00:50:41,939 --> 00:50:47,189
cheaper always on chat shows.
And this is where a lot of stuff

860
00:50:47,189 --> 00:50:52,499
has gone wrong. You know, the,
in fact, I think the short form

861
00:50:53,189 --> 00:50:58,319
or you know, the limited Ron
eight episode, true crime,

862
00:50:58,499 --> 00:51:02,249
fabulous format, but you just
got to have a couple of really

863
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:06,059
good people who get together and
do this as almost as a theater

864
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:08,819
troupe. You know, someone's got
to be able to do the editing,

865
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:11,819
you've all got to be in it for,
you know, for the love of what

866
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,789
you're doing. Because there's
just not enough money to go

867
00:51:14,789 --> 00:51:17,669
around to be funding these
projects, which from what the

868
00:51:17,669 --> 00:51:21,419
Hollywood Reporter is saying are
basically pilots is basically a

869
00:51:21,419 --> 00:51:27,119
pile. And I know that Dana
Brunetti, who was a you know,

870
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,869
big no agenda guy. And he also
got he got very interested in

871
00:51:30,869 --> 00:51:33,239
podcasting 2.0 with the
transcripts and chapter

872
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:38,309
features. He did 50 Shades of
Grey, and was the producer on

873
00:51:39,419 --> 00:51:44,729
House of Cards, top notch guy,
top notch guy. And he he's, I

874
00:51:44,729 --> 00:51:47,789
want to do a podcast network. I
said, No, you don't. But okay,

875
00:51:47,999 --> 00:51:50,969
so I want to do a podcast
network. Basically, it's all

876
00:51:50,969 --> 00:51:55,949
scripts, it's all pilots, it's
all pitches. And of course, it

877
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:58,379
became a very expensive
proposition because people are

878
00:51:58,379 --> 00:52:01,559
now trying to make audio dramas
out of them. And there's really

879
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:06,179
only room for a few and a few
that will be will be big hits,

880
00:52:06,179 --> 00:52:13,619
and it just is limited and who
can do that stuff. And all the

881
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:16,259
other podcasts, it's just like
blogging. When that started, I'm

882
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:19,169
gonna be a millionaire. I'm
gonna be the next Joe Rogan.

883
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:21,239
It's just it's not that simple.

884
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,180
Dave Jones: I'm glad you brought
that up, because this this is

885
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:34,140
the perfect time for me to say
dai you suck. I mean, like it is

886
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:37,560
Dai is, and this is the part of

887
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:41,639
Adam Curry: dynamic add insert
insertions. Yet

888
00:52:42,749 --> 00:52:48,359
Dave Jones: this, it needs. This
feels like shouting in the wind.

889
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:51,779
But it needs to stop stop
sucking before it ruins

890
00:52:51,779 --> 00:52:56,879
everything. The part of what
Marco was saying on there was

891
00:52:56,909 --> 00:53:01,739
about chapters was that the
dynamic ad insertion messes up

892
00:53:01,739 --> 00:53:07,259
the timing on chapters. Right
and the so if you look at the

893
00:53:07,259 --> 00:53:09,809
tray, if you look at the
namespace, you've got

894
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:15,299
transcripts, chapters and
soundbites, the out of let's see

895
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:23,579
20 to 20 out of 20 tags in the
namespace. Three of them can be

896
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:29,699
affected by dynamic by lousy
dynamic ad insertion. So if, if

897
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:33,629
we think about dynamic ad
insertion for what it it will,

898
00:53:33,659 --> 00:53:37,589
first of all chapters can be
done and transcripts and sound

899
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:42,239
bites, all three can be done and
take dynamic ad insertion into

900
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:45,749
account. Perfectly fine.
Buzzsprout does it right now.

901
00:53:47,399 --> 00:53:51,839
All of their time spent stamps
are modified when the ads go in.

902
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:51,929
Yeah,

903
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:53,849
Adam Curry: bus bras, the only
one I think that really pays

904
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:54,689
attention to that.

905
00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:00,360
Dave Jones: That is it can be
done if you if you care about

906
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:06,150
it. End to End soup to nuts to
make this thing to make it stay

907
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:15,090
consistent. Dynamic ad insertion
into your audio that results in

908
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:22,950
screwing up the timing of your
other metadata points is like

909
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:28,200
inserting dynamic banner ads
into your website which randomly

910
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,140
screw up your CSS and change the
way your website layout

911
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,370
Adam Curry: tortured,
hallelujah.

912
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:36,810
Dave Jones: This is what we're
going to run into. We would not

913
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:41,250
tolerate that on the web. We
would not tolerate an ad coming

914
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:45,750
in dynamically and changing the
entire look and feel of the

915
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:49,890
website or the or all the sudden
making the web making the font

916
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:50,370
bigger.

917
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,430
Adam Curry: We tolerate so much.
I mean, just the other day I was

918
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:59,700
listening to pod news weekly
review and it just cuts in the

919
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:04,200
comments. Session, let's take a
break tu tu tu tu tu. And then

920
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,280
it comes back in and I forgot
what they were talking about. It

921
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:08,850
was brutal,

922
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:14,220
Dave Jones: brutal. If you let a
dynamic ad insertion, blow up

923
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:18,930
your website layout, you've
chosen easy money over and over

924
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:24,750
content quality. In that, that
is the the problem here. The

925
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:31,170
point of podcasting is audio. If
you let a dynamic ad provider,

926
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,670
just blow up your audio and and
your feed and make your fan

927
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:40,680
screw that it is a poor
experience all the way around. I

928
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,600
mean, I, in some ways, I don't

929
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:44,879
Adam Curry: say we should not
allow.

930
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:50,700
Dave Jones: I agree Satan, I
think you're exactly right. We

931
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:55,020
should not allow this is that
wasn't appropriate voice for

932
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,010
what Dai is

933
00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:00,990
Adam Curry: the evil. Evil is a
tool of Satan show title.

934
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:06,120
Dave Jones: It is a tool of
Beelzebub. And that should be

935
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:10,320
it's a darkness a dark tool.
Yeah, and here's what's gonna

936
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:16,740
happen. Everybody's everybody's
dar implementations that went in

937
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:23,520
with no care about any of the
supporting structure, like the

938
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,990
trap chapters, transcripts, all
this because it is going to end

939
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:33,630
result in things being screwed
up from here on out. And then

940
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:38,160
the DA market is going to tank
when everybody floods in to try

941
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,370
and do dir because host raids
aren't making any money. The

942
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:44,250
CPMs are going to go down and
we're going to end up with punch

943
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,550
the monkey banner ads. In audio,

944
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,750
Adam Curry: I forgot all about
punch the monkey. That's what's

945
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:54,360
gonna happen once the monkey and
whack a mole. Remember that rock

946
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:54,630
and roll?

947
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,570
Dave Jones: You're gonna have
the equivalent that is what

948
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:00,390
we're going to be left with this
disgusting audio as

949
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:02,550
Adam Curry: well. Honestly, when
it comes to the ad market, we're

950
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:06,240
still basically counting hips. I
mean, yeah, it's all bullshit.

951
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:11,280
It's not without any it's not
real IAB is is bullshit,

952
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,150
bullshit numbers. I mean, I love
that's why I love op three, op

953
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:17,370
three, at least it's open,
everyone can see what it is. You

954
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:20,730
can agree you can disagree. But
it's all the same for everybody.

955
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:25,230
Now, but when you get all these
different ways of counting and

956
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:29,430
not counting and who cares? A
download or listen, time spent

957
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:32,790
list? I got all those steps. I
got all the time spent

958
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:37,020
completion rate. Yeah, my
completion rate here at home was

959
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,790
100%. Let me know. I mean, I'm
just telling you.

960
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:43,410
Dave Jones: I think you mean
it's a whole five

961
00:57:43,409 --> 00:57:44,159
Adam Curry: by five.

962
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,080
Dave Jones: Oh, no cat

963
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:51,329
Adam Curry: and all counts,
baby. Exactly. Yeah, I feel bad

964
00:57:51,329 --> 00:57:55,529
about it. But I understand
because there was such a hype.

965
00:57:55,949 --> 00:58:00,059
Certainly in the last couple of
years, so much free money. So

966
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:05,609
much. D E is going into
podcasting. Cuz that's what the

967
00:58:05,609 --> 00:58:09,029
you know, all that money's dried
up. Now. Notice there's no more

968
00:58:09,029 --> 00:58:13,319
Africa podcast day and, and
bipoc podcast day, that's all

969
00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:16,049
starting to fade away because
the money is kind of drying up.

970
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:17,579
Now.

971
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:19,950
Dave Jones: Right?

972
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:25,829
Adam Curry: mean, it just seems
to me that, you know, money in

973
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:30,299
money out I mean, it, there's
just less of it. And it was a

974
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:32,519
lot of people were riding high
on the hog. The podcast

975
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:35,519
Industrial Complex was there.
And now you know, you get

976
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:38,459
YouTube saying they'll do
something or soft toss or toss

977
00:58:38,459 --> 00:58:40,079
away stuff. They don't really
care.

978
00:58:40,589 --> 00:58:42,659
Dave Jones: They really don't do
things like inclusion

979
00:58:42,659 --> 00:58:45,269
initiatives when you have lots
of money. Yeah, but then, you

980
00:58:45,269 --> 00:58:48,779
know, but then when you have,
when you're cutting, even the

981
00:58:48,779 --> 00:58:51,599
people you have, that you see
how important those things

982
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,599
actually are to people. Because
they, you know, they're like,

983
00:58:54,629 --> 00:58:58,169
Oh, well, you know, we got to
let you know, we don't care that

984
00:58:58,169 --> 00:59:01,199
much. We get this money thing,
you know?

985
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,660
Adam Curry: Yeah, it's like,
they're not even they don't even

986
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:06,960
talk to Cridland. I mean, we
want to do anything in podcast

987
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,520
and you gotta at least talk to
Cridland,

988
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:11,850
Dave Jones: we care enough and
we care a whole bunch until it

989
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:13,590
affects the stock price. And
then we don't care about

990
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:17,130
Adam Curry: the exact the people
that care for the podcasters is

991
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:20,640
right here in this group. People
who care the ones that podcast

992
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,650
index dot social, they actually
care. Now, I still truly believe

993
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:28,950
the reason why this project is
working is because everybody has

994
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:33,270
a shot at at a cut of the money
flow. Everybody's got a chance

995
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:36,690
at and everybody can include
themselves. I really believe

996
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:40,530
that that's a big part of the of
the of the of the I mean that

997
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,040
it's exciting to me every day. I
wake up

998
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:47,879
Dave Jones: go ahead with value
for value. All that matters is

999
00:59:47,879 --> 00:59:51,299
the is the quality of the
content. Yeah, yeah. If you make

1000
00:59:51,299 --> 00:59:56,819
a good product, you get value.
That's there's no other. There's

1001
00:59:56,819 --> 00:59:58,739
no other secret sauce. You don't
you

1002
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,620
Adam Curry: don't have to buy
adds in games that you know that

1003
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:05,100
start auto downloading or
convince people to click on

1004
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,890
stuff now you're absolutely
right. And I get great

1005
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:10,110
statistics. Speaking of which,
by the way,

1006
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:12,929
Dave Jones: you have statistics.
Yeah, I

1007
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:18,360
Adam Curry: got lots of stats,
contracts, contracts CLN, sh a x

1008
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:22,710
dot app, it is doing something
very interesting. I wanted to

1009
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:27,270
pitch this to other people who
listen to this podcast. So they

1010
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:31,890
are statistics company, I guess
their company was really, it's

1011
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:37,140
really just an app. And that app
loads in your browser that it's

1012
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:41,670
without a server, I think,
almost server lists. And all

1013
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:44,280
your stats are loaded up and
they run in your browser. And I

1014
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,880
think they're doing with that
with web assembly, that was not

1015
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,570
the way what it is web assembly.
And so they said, hey, you know,

1016
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:56,370
we want to, we want to be a part
of the flow. So can we have

1017
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:59,940
access to the podcaster wallet,
which we had done previously for

1018
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:03,900
fountain? And you don't have to
tell me who else who else. So

1019
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:07,590
you can actually stream Satoshis
rather the first ones. So

1020
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:11,640
contracts is now actively out
there. Marketing to podcasters,

1021
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,210
Hey, come on in, look at all the
stats we'll give you give you a

1022
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:20,130
wallet, we sign you up, we make
you value for value enabled. And

1023
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,880
and you can manage your splits
right here. And we're a

1024
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,880
statistics provider. And of
course, they I don't know

1025
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,090
exactly what they take, but you
know, but they've they have, you

1026
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:32,280
know, the wallet can wherever
they are getting Satoshi

1027
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:37,140
somewhere in the flow. I want to
pitch to anybody who wants to do

1028
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:41,400
this, we have what I think is
called a Partner API. Some

1029
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,930
special access anything you even
if you just want to be an

1030
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:50,670
onboarding partner, you know,
you can you can do a deal with

1031
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:54,810
Alby or possibly with breeze
coming up or you know, or

1032
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:57,810
voltage or, and there's so many
different people you can do a

1033
01:01:57,810 --> 01:02:01,800
deal with a pot with with
wallets. Or maybe your wallet

1034
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:08,160
provider I don't know. Or maybe
you just do a an arm's length

1035
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,540
deal and connect people into get
Alby doesn't matter, you can

1036
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:16,830
onboard people into value for
value and get a piece of the

1037
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:19,350
action for doing that. And I
really want to encourage people

1038
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:23,430
to think about doing that. It's
a great way to move value for

1039
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:28,080
value forward when we're growing
at about 100 new podcasts a day.

1040
01:02:29,219 --> 01:02:31,499
Dave Jones: That brings up
that's that actually makes me

1041
01:02:31,499 --> 01:02:33,839
want to bring up Daniel J.
Lewis, his comment about the

1042
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:34,529
fees?

1043
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,800
Adam Curry: Yes, please. Well,

1044
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,370
Dave Jones: I think I mean, it's
not it's not too much to get

1045
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:46,320
into. But I think that, here's
the way that I look at the My

1046
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,790
reasoning for lightning based
value for value is really

1047
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:56,700
simple. It's undie, platform
mobile. If that's a word,

1048
01:02:57,869 --> 01:03:00,449
Adam Curry: we prefer to say
censorship resistant,

1049
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:04,170
Dave Jones: it's okay. Also
known as on D platform,

1050
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:06,929
Adam Curry: let me just write
that down another show title.

1051
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:12,030
Dave Jones: No middlemen, the
payment goes from directly from

1052
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:17,400
the listener directly to you.
There's nobody in between. And

1053
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:23,280
the fees are small, very tiny
networks, you run it yourself.

1054
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,660
But in order 123, those are the
way those are the order of

1055
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:33,360
importance that I see those that
correct. The higher fees that he

1056
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:38,430
is talking about, all come from
add on services. So if if I

1057
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:42,630
haven't, if I if I run a number
on myself list, I'm just going

1058
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:47,790
to give a scenario. If I run an
umbrella in my house, and I also

1059
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:53,370
run a podcast zone, those
lightning value value payments

1060
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:57,480
coming from the listener to me,
the fees are virtually non

1061
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:03,540
existent. Correct, they're very,
very small, way less than

1062
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:10,530
anything else you can get. Now,
if I have a custodial wallet

1063
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:16,020
somewhere, let's just say with
blueberry, or Alby or some other

1064
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,450
place that okay that they're
going to take a percentage

1065
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,070
because you've given you're now
using their service and also you

1066
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:26,820
add on a cot, you know,
contracts for staff. But

1067
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:29,670
there's, you know, you're you're
now using somebody else's sir,

1068
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:34,170
all these serve all these fees,
they're coming from additional

1069
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,680
services that people are
offering, but those aren't, but

1070
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:41,550
at the low of this, that's the
difference is at the at the most

1071
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:45,030
fundamental level, in the
lightening value for value

1072
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:50,970
ecosystem. I can run it myself
and avoid all that. Yes. But in

1073
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:55,620
the other system, the Patreon
the the you know, these other

1074
01:04:55,950 --> 01:05:00,120
papers, you can't you don't even
have that option. You were

1075
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:04,380
excluded in the Fiat world from
from participating in that

1076
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:05,490
whatsoever in

1077
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:08,670
Adam Curry: addition, so that I
think a good example. And now

1078
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:12,480
apps will charge what apps want
to charge. And I, and it's

1079
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:18,480
unfortunate but the fee, label,
you know, the network fee, for

1080
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:23,640
actually transferring a payment
is not the same as a fee that is

1081
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:27,060
taken by an app or a service,
yet, they're both called a fee.

1082
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:32,340
Voila, it is what it is. But if
you take the plugin, the pod

1083
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:36,930
press plug in, I think it is
power press. So there's a 3%

1084
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:41,310
fee, they tack on for that. If
you don't like it, it's a free

1085
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:46,200
market. It's a free market, you
can you can go to some other

1086
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:49,770
servers who do it for less.
Same, we were saying with

1087
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:54,180
podcast apps, if a podcast app
is charging 5%, and your

1088
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:57,390
listeners don't like it, your
listeners can use a different

1089
01:05:57,390 --> 01:06:02,160
app, you can recommend a
different app. This is this is

1090
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,620
the open market this is you
know, and it's we're already

1091
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:07,470
getting close to having enough
competition out there that it

1092
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:12,990
will naturally kind of drive the
prices down. It's beautiful that

1093
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:16,800
way. And ultimately, as you
point out, you can have an

1094
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:21,810
umbrella at home on your cable
modem. And wherever, wherever

1095
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:26,130
you want to host host your
files. And you can keep that

1096
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:28,620
really within your own realm,
which is the beauty of

1097
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:31,080
podcasting. And you'll still be
listed right up there with all

1098
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:34,230
the big boys and podcasts. Next,
it comes out of the same API.

1099
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:39,210
Dave Jones: In the end, there's
an M M, I'm not saying that

1100
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:42,510
everybody can run an umbrella.
I'm, that's not at all what I'm

1101
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:48,870
saying. I'm saying in this in
this framework in this scenario,

1102
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:54,060
you you could if you wanted to,
if you wanted to go learn it,

1103
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:57,780
and you or if you have the the
ability, or if you know somebody

1104
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:02,430
that can help you, you can do it
yourself. In the other world you

1105
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:06,420
can't. That's that is to me that
is the fundamental difference of

1106
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:10,440
what's better everything else.
Everything else is just sort of

1107
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,640
like gravy on top of that,

1108
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:13,800
Adam Curry: including the the
fact that micro payments

1109
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:17,970
themselves are just not feasible
in any other system. In a Fiat

1110
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:23,160
Fiat world is just not possible.
Right. Right. We're so smart.

1111
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:30,630
Dave Jones: That's the same
thing. You know, do you see red

1112
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:35,250
circle started popping? No, I
didn't cool. Yes. Yeah. They

1113
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:38,820
started they started and there's
so he might Kayden over at Red

1114
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:42,510
Circle started the pod pain flow
a couple of days ago, and he's

1115
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:46,260
easy said he's got about 13,000
feets he thinks Wow. Fantastic.

1116
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:49,290
Yes. So that's coming on board.
We've got there's somebody

1117
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:52,830
there's another host, a larger
host that is about to start

1118
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,590
popping in that I cannot reveal
yet.

1119
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:00,209
Adam Curry: Oh, Todd Cochran,
all of a sudden, I just, I

1120
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:04,889
can't. I had a very interesting
conversation. I can't talk. You

1121
01:08:04,889 --> 01:08:09,539
can't say it yet. Don't worry.
It's coming. In the crowning.

1122
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:14,399
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry.

1123
01:08:15,389 --> 01:08:19,739
Dave Jones: I like to just say,
give a heads up, even though I'm

1124
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:22,589
being coy. I like to give a
heads up because I'd like I like

1125
01:08:22,589 --> 01:08:26,099
people to hear that things are
happening. So they, they realize

1126
01:08:26,099 --> 01:08:29,729
that they're the things move
slow, you know, things in the in

1127
01:08:29,729 --> 01:08:33,449
open source projects. Prior and
then podcasting, especially

1128
01:08:33,449 --> 01:08:36,689
things move slow. So I like to
let people know that there is

1129
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,059
momentum and things are
happening and don't get

1130
01:08:39,059 --> 01:08:42,239
discouraged. Even even because
they're going oh, this

1131
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:46,050
Adam Curry: is so much
happening. I mean, I have to say

1132
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:49,980
especially blueberry, big props.
I listened to their podcast

1133
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:54,900
insider, all about namespace all
about the new features, that

1134
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:59,340
Todd has seen the writing on the
wall, them and I really

1135
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:03,210
appreciate that about him. He's
just gone. I know, everything's

1136
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:07,200
flat. So we got to go, you know,
everyone's zigging, you ever

1137
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:11,670
we're gonna zag. We'll go over
and do this. And he's really

1138
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:16,140
pushing and he's educating. And
he's, he's doing it himself. Now

1139
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,900
he's, he's eating the dog food,
which is important. It's really

1140
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:24,960
important. And, you know, this
is the difference between making

1141
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:30,480
bold, especially value for value
work, is by following you know,

1142
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:35,460
the general guidelines, the
general format of explaining

1143
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:38,520
value, you want value back,
there's a feedback loop, you got

1144
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:42,840
to thank people. You know, you
got to do it consistently. And

1145
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:46,560
for my money, you should also be
mentioning the amount of

1146
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,400
Satoshis that you're receiving.
Because it first of all, is very

1147
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:54,450
transparent. People love that.
It's also very aspirational. And

1148
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:58,110
we've seen that ourselves. Like,
just with that live thing we did

1149
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:02,430
with the dance party. If I
didn't tell people to request I

1150
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:05,820
didn't tell people to boost 5000
SATs more for each song. I

1151
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:08,130
didn't come up with that. But I
accepted it.

1152
01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:12,030
Dave Jones: As you're breaking,
you're breaking the rules based

1153
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:13,110
podcasting order.

1154
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,980
Adam Curry: This international
international rules of

1155
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,510
podcasting rules based order.

1156
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,630
Dave Jones: Yeah, exactly. In
the in the internet in the

1157
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:23,970
international rules based
podcasting order. We're like

1158
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:24,780
North Korea.

1159
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,550
Adam Curry: Yeah, we're lobbing
missiles everywhere. There does

1160
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:35,130
Dave Jones: that. Fancy Japan
mostly. They were in the air at

1161
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:35,550
one point.

1162
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:40,290
Adam Curry: I just want to do a
couple of quick boosts that

1163
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:44,490
we've been receiving since since
starting Dred Scott who of

1164
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:49,920
course we love 33,333 He wants a
birthday shout out. Well, of

1165
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,930
course. Happy birthday. Happy
birthday drab. I think was his

1166
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:57,150
panties that were left on the
turntable yesterday. I'm

1167
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:59,280
Dave Jones: not quite sure. Hey,
now Hey,

1168
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:04,170
Adam Curry: thank you to phone
boy. Cuz I I did interrupt his

1169
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:08,130
show, or we interrupted his show
on the stream. 6969 sent that

1170
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:10,800
twice. Actually. He said never
thought I'd be a lead in for the

1171
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,500
pod father on a Saturday,
Phoenix and I appreciate all

1172
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:17,040
you're doing to advance
podcasting. Come experience the

1173
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:22,050
Lotus effect for yourself at
oops, at Lotus effect dot show.

1174
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:25,440
And thank you very much for
letting us letting us break in

1175
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:32,640
like that. We just shot in here
sir Spencer 16969 Thanks again.

1176
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,070
Dave. For the wonderful time
Sunday. I'm bowls with buds.

1177
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:38,520
Thanks, Adam for the club 30
throwback in the rowdy boardroom

1178
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:43,350
dance party. Yes, anyone can run
an unbroken, not everyone is

1179
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:48,390
willing but for minimal effort.
Everyone is capable. I think

1180
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:53,400
that's actually kind of true.
They do minimum, a man's just as

1181
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:56,910
much to learn how to set up a
podcast is to set that up.

1182
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,750
Dave Jones: People set up a
stereo system. That's not easy,

1183
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:01,230
either. I remember

1184
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:03,960
Adam Curry: those days. You got
to strip the wires for the

1185
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,220
speaker connectors.

1186
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,650
Dave Jones: Yeah. And your mom
would always call you and ask

1187
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:09,030
you wouldn't How do you turn it
on? You

1188
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:12,300
Adam Curry: turn it off? Are you
connected properly? Watch cable.

1189
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:19,890
Okay, let's see. Well, we'll do
more, we'll do more boost in a

1190
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:20,340
second.

1191
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:30,180
Dave Jones: Added enclosure. So
dad was working with Dan

1192
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:35,820
Benjamin on a on a project of
his and he needed he needed a

1193
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:36,600
way to

1194
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:37,650
Adam Curry: are you an advisor?

1195
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:46,440
Dave Jones: Yes, yeah. I'm an
8am, an unpaid adviser. The the

1196
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:52,080
API, he needed a way to call the
API and say, Okay, I've got an

1197
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:57,960
iTunes ID and an enclosure URL.
I don't know any other way to

1198
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:01,680
reach outside. He's like I got I
want. I know the enclosure URL

1199
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:05,550
of the episode I need to get.
And I know the iTunes ID of the

1200
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:10,320
feed. So I given those two
things. I want to be able to

1201
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,190
give them to the index to the
API and have in Have you

1202
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:19,050
returned the show the episode.
So we did that. So that's

1203
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,530
interesting. That's in there
now. So if you have if you hit a

1204
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:27,690
scenario where you're like, I
don't know the episode GUID, or

1205
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:31,230
any other the title or really
anything else about the episode,

1206
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:36,930
all I know is the enclosure URL.
You can now submit you can now

1207
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,410
add that on as an extra
parameter to the episodes by

1208
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:43,950
iTunes ID your episodes by feed
ID endpoints. And it will give

1209
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:47,100
you back the correct episode
information.

1210
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:51,210
Adam Curry: Okay. Yes, that
sounds like a cool endpoint.

1211
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,490
Dave Jones: That's pretty neat.
We hang in

1212
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:55,470
Adam Curry: that all night. Oh,
episode.

1213
01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:01,740
Dave Jones: We were moving
forward then. The API.

1214
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:05,040
Adam Curry: Good. pretty rich,
getting pretty rich there, Dave?

1215
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,140
Dave Jones: stuff with it? Yeah,
you can do a lot of stuff with

1216
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,480
it. I don't think I even talked
about on the show that you can

1217
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:18,000
now get live items back from the
episodes endpoint. So if you

1218
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,400
call the episodes by feed ID
endpoint to give it a feed ID or

1219
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:29,160
a feed URL. It will hand you
back the episodes and the live

1220
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:34,290
items. If if the show is live,
has live out of scheduled or

1221
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:39,930
live currently, you will get
those back to there's there's a

1222
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:42,930
lot of stuff that I only post
about, like when we change the

1223
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:45,390
API. I'm only posting about it
on podcast index dot social, and

1224
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:46,890
I forget to talk about it on the
show.

1225
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:51,480
Adam Curry: No, this was good.
There was something else I saw

1226
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:59,880
on the GitHub. An author tag you
were talking about. I think just

1227
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:00,510
some So you're

1228
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:02,550
Dave Jones: ready to talk about
publisher?

1229
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:05,280
Adam Curry: Publisher? Yeah.
Publisher author. Yes.

1230
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:10,830
Dave Jones: So there's a
proposal for a tag. This is

1231
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:12,720
namespace talk. You want to drop
that? Oh,

1232
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,180
Adam Curry: I'm sorry. We
haven't done that in quite a

1233
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:22,500
while. And now it's time for
some hot namespace talk. Yeah,

1234
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:26,550
so I heard the dance party last
night. Yeah. Jennifer came right

1235
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:30,360
in, man. She's like, she's
partying down.

1236
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:33,750
Dave Jones: It is 730. On
Saturday. Nice. I mean, that's

1237
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:34,200
appropriate.

1238
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:36,360
Adam Curry: It's okay. For now.
Yeah.

1239
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:42,570
Dave Jones: So that there was a
proposal for a publisher, a way

1240
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:47,730
to track publishers of shows
instead of just simply the, the,

1241
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:53,730
the host of the show. So if you
have, like a way to for you to

1242
01:15:53,730 --> 01:16:00,600
go in and say, Okay, I want to
see all of the podcasts by I

1243
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:04,830
don't know what at wondery or
luminary, or NPR just made NPR,

1244
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:10,590
NPR is NPR. Some of them are
tagged correctly, or tagged in a

1245
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:13,980
way that you can do that some of
them aren't. If there was a tag

1246
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:20,520
there that was specifically for
that. In the so he gives the

1247
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:24,420
reference of the iTunes author
tag, which is supposed to kind

1248
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:29,220
of be that way. But it's, it's a
little too freeform. And so the

1249
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:33,180
freeform of the of it. Again,
not a word, but the free form 80

1250
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:40,560
of it is a little problematic,
because you can't it gets messy.

1251
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:45,540
Is it? You know, if you have to,
if you have two publishers,

1252
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:48,270
let's just say it's a joint
effort between the New York

1253
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:52,410
Times and cereal Yeah. Are you
just gonna have freeform text in

1254
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:55,320
their New York Times and cereal?
And then another one may say

1255
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,910
cereal a New York Times? No,
that's

1256
01:16:56,910 --> 01:16:59,340
Adam Curry: not that's not
that's not structured data

1257
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:05,760
Dave Jones: is not structured
data. So he proposed a way to do

1258
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,910
it by, you know, will in a more
structured way where you have

1259
01:17:08,910 --> 01:17:11,850
multiple entries there where
it's for each publisher,

1260
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:17,310
enclosed in sort of a parent
tag. And then you can ease more

1261
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:20,850
easily aggregate that and then
go back after the fact and say,

1262
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:23,880
show me all the podcasts by the
New York Times and you get them

1263
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:27,810
all. Together. think there needs
more comments on that though?

1264
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:31,380
Adam Curry: Okay. I have a link
to it in the in the show notes.

1265
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:35,700
Dave Jones: Because I'm a little
I think it's not. It needs that

1266
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:38,610
it. I see what he's doing. And I
like it, but it does need some

1267
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:41,130
work. And I think there just
needs to be more voices in there

1268
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:49,860
commenting on it would be good.
Also in the namespace. On that

1269
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:53,280
side of things, let's see what
actually didn't me. I didn't

1270
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,860
have another namespace you get
anything else I get find this?

1271
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:59,640
Adam Curry: Yes. I wanted to
give another plug for the

1272
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:04,170
transcript search tool, which
Steven B put together. He needs

1273
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:08,010
a domain name right now. It's
transcript das search dot versal

1274
01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:13,170
dot app. Not a great name. No,
but it's it's how we started

1275
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:16,650
everything off. And he uses that
kind of as his building place.

1276
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:21,750
This thing is outstanding. And
I'm not sure how to integrate it

1277
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:26,850
into public life. I use it all
the time. I mean, you literally

1278
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:33,300
type in A C podcasting. 2.0 and
you can search the directory,

1279
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:37,260
that was my request. Okay, there
it is podcasting. 2.0. And then

1280
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:40,590
you can say Alright, now I'm
going to do a search term. So

1281
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:43,680
let's give me a search term.
That's crazy. Dave, what's

1282
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,420
something that we could use in
our

1283
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:45,900
Dave Jones: show?

1284
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:48,720
Adam Curry: Yeah, in our show,
yeah. Something that's gonna

1285
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,220
show up once or twice.

1286
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:56,130
Dave Jones: Just only once or
twice. Oh my gosh. Okay, cake.

1287
01:18:56,310 --> 01:19:00,120
See, aka Jenkins

1288
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:05,340
Adam Curry: Well turns out
episode 118 one occurrence, and

1289
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:09,570
I can click on the timecode and
then I can hit play these things

1290
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:13,050
that was just icing on the cake
for a corporation to score

1291
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:18,630
brownie points. Oh, come on.
That's pretty rad. Episode 100

1292
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:22,470
streamers and dreamers 158 17

1293

Unknown: craft services table

1294
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:25,320
Prosecco.

1295
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:30,210
Adam Curry: Even got it from
from a clip. This is good.

1296
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:34,080
Dave Jones: That is red. is rad.
Correct? Yeah,

1297
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:37,890
Adam Curry: let's see if RAD is
in there. Let's see rad. Rad.

1298
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:42,780
Seems like there's a lot in
there. Also picks up rod Do you

1299
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:49,380
know the traditional way maybe
if I do it in quotes, I wonder

1300
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:53,190
how well that search is. Let me
see. Yeah, nothing when I do it

1301
01:19:53,190 --> 01:19:57,540
and in quotes nothing. How about
radio and now it doesn't,

1302
01:19:57,990 --> 01:20:02,160
doesn't do the Boolean
unfortunate Ellie just says it's

1303
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:05,310
beautiful something something
needs to be done with this tool

1304
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:10,620
other than just, I use it. I use
it all the time, particularly

1305
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:15,870
when divorce acts as a dad. Now
I can just go Yeah, you did. And

1306
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:18,000
I boom, click click, you saw a
fast I did that.

1307
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:22,170
Dave Jones: That's really very

1308
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:25,140
Adam Curry: impressive is very,
very impressive. And firstly, it

1309
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:28,740
needs a domain names to even be
first of all these domain name.

1310
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:33,510
It's just it's it's fantastic.
It's a great tool.

1311
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:38,520
Dave Jones: I found Okay, so I
found this the so we have we

1312
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:44,820
have phase six here. And we've
got a few tags, I think we need

1313
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:49,830
to start to coalesce around what
what we think is going to get to

1314
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:51,540
has a chance to make it in
there.

1315
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:52,800
Adam Curry: Okay, what was the

1316
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:58,290
Dave Jones: list? There is?
Value see the secret message.

1317
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:05,640
There's the state tag, which I'm
sure Daniel has a comment about

1318
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:12,300
the name of that. The state tag
is just some way to identify

1319
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:17,280
where weather this some things
about this feed that don't

1320
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:21,510
really fit into other
categories. So things like is it

1321
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:26,820
free? Is it premium? That kind
of that kind of thing? As it is

1322
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:31,470
a paid for feed? Let's see what
the let's see what I've got in

1323
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:36,870
there already. Yeah, so is it?
Is it true? Is this under a

1324
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:42,630
trial? Is the podcast on hiatus?
Is it a subscription only? Is

1325
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:47,610
it? Is it an under a trial
period by the published by the

1326
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:51,510
hosting platform, sort of some
stuff about the feed that you

1327
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:58,230
might want to know. But it's you
could group them together. And

1328
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:00,990
this may not be a great way to
do it. I'm just I just threw

1329
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:07,050
this out there for comment, then
you have John Spurlock's events.

1330
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:10,650
Adam Curry: Yes, yes. Yes. Yes.
Well, that really needs some

1331
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:11,910
work the events tag.

1332
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:16,590
Dave Jones: It's got a lot of
commentary on it right here.

1333
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:21,840
Okay. And, and I feel like we
need to start trying to decide

1334
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,640
whether or not that can actually
get get refined to in a way that

1335
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:33,570
everybody's happy with to get
into Phase six. The C D has

1336
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:38,340
guests, James grillin. proposed
a tag. There's just a simple

1337
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:43,440
Boolean tag. Patek podcast co
lon has guests, yes or no,

1338
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:50,670
right. And it's just, it's just
what it says on the box. A lot

1339
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:52,080
of people seem to like this
idea.

1340
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:54,120
Adam Curry: Yeah, sounds good.
That sounds good to me.

1341
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:57,810
Dave Jones: My first thought
when I saw it was math. And then

1342
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:01,290
like, and then I thought about
it. And I'm like, you know, that

1343
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:03,540
actually is pretty good idea.
There's really not another way

1344
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:09,780
to get that. And a lot of these
tags are about it seems like in

1345
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:14,130
phase six, there's a lot of
stuff around just giving

1346
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:18,990
information that is not, maybe
it's not necessary, it's not

1347
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:25,140
critical to the show. But it's
helpful to have Dara say,

1348
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:31,860
discovery. Like, I can see this
feeding. So these fall under a

1349
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:40,080
category to me of, of bits of
information that you as the

1350
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:45,930
podcaster may want to let other
let the world know. It's it's

1351
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:50,160
not. It's sort of like, like,
like the person tag, or the

1352
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:56,880
location tag, it's it's just, I
can put this into my show, I can

1353
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,390
mark this in my show at my
hosting company that gives a

1354
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:07,410
signal to the world about what
they can expect to find in my

1355
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:12,630
show. I found those sorts of
things to be valuable, because,

1356
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:16,560
you know, some people just
don't, they don't like interview

1357
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:19,860
shows. They're just not that
like, it's I'm never gonna

1358
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:23,130
listen to an interview show. I
don't really listen to hardly

1359
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:26,790
any interview shows. I guess
it's just not my thing. And so

1360
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:30,300
if it's a show that has guests,
I'm probably not gonna listen to

1361
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:38,550
it. And I can see that being
just more you know, ways to let

1362
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:43,320
the universe know about what are
the sort of the framework of

1363
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:52,260
what your show is? Again, not
not critical, but helpful. Um,

1364
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:52,410
hold

1365
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:56,010
Adam Curry: on one second. Let
me let me tell you, like, let me

1366
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:56,610
test this.

1367
01:24:57,690 --> 01:24:59,580
Dave Jones: My first thought
when I saw it was math

1368
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,600
Adam Curry: They go long live
the ISO bought

1369
01:25:04,169 --> 01:25:06,989
Dave Jones: the ISO but thought
I said, Man, they thought that

1370
01:25:06,989 --> 01:25:10,469
was the most the right way to
say, man.

1371
01:25:10,949 --> 01:25:12,899
Adam Curry: Doesn't matter. I'm
still loving it.

1372
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:19,440
Dave Jones: And the remote item
tag, I really think out of the

1373
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,470
whole batch, the remote item tag
is the one I want to get in

1374
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:23,100
there the most.

1375
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:24,840
Adam Curry: I'm with you on
that. I like that idea.

1376
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:28,290
Dave Jones: I think if nothing
else, we need to get the remote

1377
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:34,020
item tag in there. Events. To
me, it goes in this order remote

1378
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:43,080
item events. And then there's
list mediums. And I think those

1379
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,150
list mediums need to go in there
as well.

1380
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:48,600
Adam Curry: Yeah, yeah, that's a
good one. Because we need we

1381
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:51,510
need. We need a lot. We need
something for that. I'm looking

1382
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:56,070
at the music side project.com.
And the search is just not

1383
01:25:56,070 --> 01:26:01,200
music. The search populates with
everything. It doesn't. Yeah,

1384
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:06,480
that's inherently not right. And
I think that, I don't know,

1385
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:11,550
maybe if you just search for any
term in them, that you think

1386
01:26:11,550 --> 01:26:13,560
would be music, I get podcast.

1387
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:18,870
Dave Jones: Oh, what if you
search for podcasting today? No,

1388
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:24,120
yeah, you get a podcast. That's
not That's not the way I think

1389
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:26,220
it should be. No, he intended
that.

1390
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:28,770
Adam Curry: Is there a way to
only search for music?

1391
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:32,040
Dave Jones: That I thought
that's what it would do? Yeah.

1392
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:32,190
But

1393
01:26:32,190 --> 01:26:34,470
Adam Curry: how do we have an
API endpoint?

1394
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:38,970
Unknown: I thought we did.

1395
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:44,460
Adam Curry: Maybe not. Yikes.
Maybe we do. Here's another

1396
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:47,040
question. Is wavelike Tada. We

1397
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,090
Dave Jones: do we do, don't we?

1398
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:50,220
Adam Curry: I don't know. I'm
not in charge of that.

1399
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:56,490
Dave Jones: Wave. Wave like is
not pod pinging? They're not no

1400
01:26:57,690 --> 01:26:59,910
Adam Curry: but they but they
are adding stuff to the to the

1401
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:00,540
index.

1402
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:04,560
Dave Jones: Hmm Yeah, well,
we're Yeah, we're picking it up.

1403
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:13,320
Okay. They submit Yeah. That
their Gosh, net now you know

1404
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:18,150
what now I feel caught off guard
because they may be pod paying

1405
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,910
me who runs this

1406
01:27:20,910 --> 01:27:23,340
Adam Curry: a I don't know who
runs anything who runs the show

1407
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:23,700
here?

1408
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:31,590
Dave Jones: Podcast? No idea.
Wow. I have no idea what

1409
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:39,870
anything. That's good. This is
good. Good question. I'm

1410
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:44,580
literally ever saw Michael ever
wave like a potty.

1411
01:27:45,450 --> 01:27:47,280
Adam Curry: That's so funny.
That's so funny.

1412
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:52,740
Dave Jones: I see. No. I see no
pod paying that I've ever sent

1413
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:55,530
to Mike. I think he's just
submitting. All right.

1414
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:57,750
Adam Curry: Because I'm super
pumped. And we're going to have

1415
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:59,160
these guys on pretty soon,
right?

1416
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:04,290
Dave Jones: Yeah, the after we
after we screwed them. After I

1417
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:04,980
screwed them over. We're

1418
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:06,840
Adam Curry: gonna have on
eventually. Right. We'll fix

1419
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:07,410
that. Yeah.

1420
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,650
Dave Jones: Okay. Yeah, I am
kind of glad that they did. I

1421
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:12,180
screwed that up. And they didn't
show up.

1422
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:13,980
Adam Curry: And that would have
been even worse. Yeah. Would

1423
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:16,080
have been worse. We had sorry,
by the way we

1424
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:18,990
Dave Jones: understand Adam,

1425
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:22,260
Adam Curry: so I was just Yeah,
right. Well, I switched to a

1426
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:25,740
different a different internet
connection. That worked. Okay.

1427
01:28:26,850 --> 01:28:29,940
But the amount of people who
said hey, I'm available, I can

1428
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:33,060
do it like Sam Sethi like hey, I
can do I can jump on right now.

1429
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:35,520
I couldn't do anything that Dave
can do. I'm like, no.

1430
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:42,240
Dave Jones: Let's see how it is.
Sam you can be okay. Exactly.

1431
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,200
You know, my back.

1432
01:28:43,770 --> 01:28:46,530
Adam Curry: And I'm like, No,
this is not gonna happen. That's

1433
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:48,840
not ever gonna happen. This is
the show.

1434
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,900
Dave Jones: Hey, James Sam's
ever ever out of town? Give me a

1435
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:52,320
call

1436
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,110
Adam Curry: Yeah, that's what
your for your friends as well.

1437
01:28:58,110 --> 01:29:00,210
The duty you read in

1438
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:01,230
Dave Jones: the back. So that's
right.

1439
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:06,930
Adam Curry: You got thanks for
people I do have. I do have

1440
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:11,310
another small item that I'm not
quite sure. I just want to bring

1441
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:14,700
it up. Because, you know, I've
been looking at noster I've been

1442
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:19,860
on noster I have a you know, my
key is there whatever. I go on

1443
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:23,850
from time to time. And I'm
sensing hostility. I don't like

1444
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:26,940
it. And I'll tell you what it
is. It goes like this.

1445
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:30,600
Podcasting to point out value
for value stocks, everything

1446
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:35,610
should be zaps and wishes okay,
because you know, like whatever

1447
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:37,770
people can say whatever they
want, because now this

1448
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:40,800
Dave Jones: thing they you just
said is this a tone that you're

1449
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,350
picking up? Or is this something
that was actually said?

1450
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:45,450
Adam Curry: No, it was said it
was said that way? There was

1451
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:47,850
there was a thread? Yeah, I
mean, of course I am

1452
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:51,000
interpreting the actual tone of
voice, which is what I

1453
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,830
translated to appropriately.
Yes, yes. And of course, Oscar

1454
01:29:55,830 --> 01:30:00,480
over the fountain immediately
makes zapping available I'm on

1455
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:06,240
fountain, to the fountain
wallet. And I'm, I'm just not

1456
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:11,100
feeling good about this. I'm not
sure what it is, other than it

1457
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:17,130
feels like Ellen, Ellen URL
mafia all over again. You know,

1458
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:21,540
like Henry, there was even a
thread like, you know, noster

1459
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:25,230
should replace RSS feeds or
whatever. There's all kinds of

1460
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:29,610
stuff and and I'm just like, I'm
not worried about any of that.

1461
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:38,910
But I want to be able to harness
the the excitement over zaps. If

1462
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:44,160
there's a valid place for that
in, in podcasting value for

1463
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:48,600
value streaming stuff, I just
don't see it. And it's kind of

1464
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:49,440
bugged me.

1465
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:54,450
Dave Jones: I mean, it's been
irritating me too. And it's so

1466
01:30:54,450 --> 01:31:00,030
this, I saw the RSS thing.
There's this cult, this,

1467
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:03,840
Adam Curry: who used to use the
C word C word you may use cult?

1468
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:05,010
No.

1469
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:09,210
Dave Jones: Maybe Maybe I
started to say culture. Oh,

1470
01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:13,290
cool. Maybe called is a root
word of culture is called. It is

1471
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:17,460
a twofer. I get them both. Yes.
Right. So there's this, there's

1472
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:19,950
this sort of like, I feel like
there's a I've been spending

1473
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:23,850
time on nostra to, to, I need to
understand this thing and what

1474
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:26,310
and what's happening over there?
And what's being said, and I

1475
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:30,000
just want I don't like, don't
like, there being all this

1476
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:31,710
motion. And I don't understand
what's happening.

1477
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:35,520
Adam Curry: Yeah, there you go.
That's exactly it. Yeah, it's

1478
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:35,850
like,

1479
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:38,880
Dave Jones: it's like this, like
a bunch of loud things, driving

1480
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,220
by your house, you know, for 15
minutes, eventually, you're

1481
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:47,430
gonna get out and look out the
window. So this spending time to

1482
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:52,920
me, I feel like there is this
culture of the sugar daddy

1483
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:57,000
culture in Austria, and I think
it comes from Dorsey the fact

1484
01:31:57,030 --> 01:32:02,580
that that Dorsey is bankrolling
a bunch of stuff over there.

1485
01:32:02,610 --> 01:32:05,820
Yeah. Agree. And that that's
where you get this sort of like,

1486
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:09,120
I'm going to pay a bounty of, of
a million sets, if somebody

1487
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:14,430
makes RSS feeds on noster. It's
like, why this is, it's just a

1488
01:32:14,430 --> 01:32:20,010
dumb idea. To me, it's the whole
it's the it's just dumb. I mean,

1489
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:23,640
there are, so you're going to
ingest an RSS feed, and then

1490
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:28,650
post it on noster. Like, what is
it? What's the point? And I

1491
01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:30,810
don't even know, I just don't
understand this. And we've

1492
01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:33,420
already we already went down
this road. That is, I think

1493
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:38,640
people, people in the not in the
Ellen URL nostra group may not

1494
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:41,730
understand that we've already
thought a lot of this stuff

1495
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:45,600
through. Yeah, we've fought the
battle to get some to get this

1496
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:51,240
stuff the way that it operates
now, and that is, you, you it is

1497
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:58,800
not the right solution to force
some to force the listener to

1498
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:03,630
create an invoice every time
they want to pay you. It's key

1499
01:33:03,630 --> 01:33:07,980
send is much as much as people
may not like he said it is the

1500
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:12,750
right answer to this problem.
And being able to, and there

1501
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:17,160
should not have to be any name
resolution, that putting a a

1502
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:24,600
node ID into a feed with key
send is the lamest and meanest

1503
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:28,170
solution. And it solves this
problem perfectly. The app

1504
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:32,820
doesn't have to do hardly any
work at all. It just, it just

1505
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:36,690
looks at the node ID and boom,
it's done. You don't have to do

1506
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:43,050
all this crazy Ellen, your LP.
Look at your nip 50 sevens. And

1507
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:46,500
all this guy's like, you got to
do all that. And so that's 10

1508
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:49,530
splits in their feed. I mean,
look at Think about how hard

1509
01:33:49,530 --> 01:33:50,370
that is for the app.

1510
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:55,590
Adam Curry: How about this? Is
there a way to make a bridge so

1511
01:33:55,590 --> 01:33:59,880
people if they're really want to
send a zap, they can zap a

1512
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:03,060
podcast and it hits the bridge,
and that splits it into keys.

1513
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:05,640
And that's something Brian of
London would build, by the way.

1514
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:08,280
It's one of those Rube Goldberg
things.

1515
01:34:10,110 --> 01:34:12,630
Dave Jones: I'm just I'm just
not interested. Okay. I'm not

1516
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:20,400
interested in the, to me. Here's
not noster has a people that I

1517
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:29,190
respect like Alex Gleason have
some interest in noster. And so

1518
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:34,230
I'm not going to say that it's a
pile of crap. But I just feel

1519
01:34:34,230 --> 01:34:38,520
like the use cases they're
trying to put it to my opinion

1520
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:42,270
is the the social media use case
was the worst.

1521
01:34:42,299 --> 01:34:43,889
Adam Curry: It's probably the
worst one they could have used.

1522
01:34:43,919 --> 01:34:44,969
I totally agree.

1523
01:34:46,230 --> 01:34:48,810
Dave Jones: It should have been
something it could have should

1524
01:34:48,810 --> 01:34:53,100
have come out of the gate with a
different use case. And because

1525
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:59,490
this this thing is just not
compelling to me. I get on my

1526
01:34:59,490 --> 01:35:03,810
app And I don't want to be like
Debbie downer, like, beat this

1527
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:07,620
thing down. Because I don't want
people doing that to the early

1528
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:11,010
work of of what we're doing here
either things that we're running

1529
01:35:11,010 --> 01:35:13,770
with scissors, they're running
with scissors. I want to be

1530
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:18,600
fair. But it's just I don't see
the point of a lot of this. A

1531
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:21,840
lot of these use cases as the
way they're being implemented

1532
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:25,680
because you have the I get on my
noster app. I mean, I forget

1533
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:32,880
what the Damas and half the time
I've got, I get on there, I

1534
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,120
start to scroll my timeline, and
then things begin are popping

1535
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:40,620
up. Like after the fact, like,
there were five seconds

1536
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:42,240
Adam Curry: the relay start to
kick in.

1537
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:46,410
Dave Jones: And then and then I
don't know where I'm at in my

1538
01:35:46,410 --> 01:35:49,560
timeline anymore, and no. Okay,
so let's scroll back up to the

1539
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:55,290
top, scroll by start start
again. And then people's names

1540
01:35:55,290 --> 01:35:59,490
are showing up as just pub keys
and generic avatars. They're

1541
01:35:59,490 --> 01:36:03,300
just permanent that way. And
then, and I tap on, then it does

1542
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:07,800
the name resolution to find out
who they are. It's just not a

1543
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:08,550
great experience

1544
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:11,310
Adam Curry: I'm seeing in the
chat room or head saying no, no,

1545
01:36:11,310 --> 01:36:14,760
no, it's easy to do. It took
less than a weekend to add Ellen

1546
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:18,300
Euro fall back. If Kishen fails,
the guys that get Alby are

1547
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:21,540
suggesting it if we need to stop
something, I need you to say it

1548
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:26,760
now. Why exactly is it not? Is
it too too much overhead for

1549
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:28,020
apps to do this.

1550
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:38,010
Dave Jones: So So if if you have
if you have to force breeze to

1551
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:41,940
on a show like ours, which which
has nine splits, if you have to

1552
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:48,810
force breeze, to do an Ellen URL
p resolution nine times every

1553
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:55,200
minute, and boosts on top of
that. That's not That's not just

1554
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:59,400
a lot of a lot of load on the
server. Imagine if you have 100

1555
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:02,340
listeners at all listening to
your podcast at the same time,

1556
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:05,010
which is where we want this
thing to be Yeah, imagine,

1557
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:11,370
imagine no agenda. You have Oh
goodness. 700 people listening

1558
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,400
live at the same time. 2000

1559
01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:15,660
Adam Curry: Let's make it 2000.
Again,

1560
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:19,470
Dave Jones: let's say 2000
people listening live on breeze.

1561
01:37:20,580 --> 01:37:24,930
Every one of those breeze apps
is sending a streaming payment

1562
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:29,730
once a minute and having to do
pretend potentially nine or 10 l

1563
01:37:29,730 --> 01:37:35,400
in your LP invoice generations
and look up processes through

1564
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:39,120
nip 57. That's a that's called a
DDoS attack.

1565
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:42,120
Adam Curry: Thank you. That's
exactly that's exactly what it

1566
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:47,520
would be. Yeah, it's just not
both ends. By the way. You'd be

1567
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,750
dossing your own app,

1568
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:52,470
Dave Jones: your is too much
overhead. You can't you can't do

1569
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:57,300
that. And the nature of the
streaming payments is is

1570
01:37:57,300 --> 01:38:01,440
critical booster great booster
grams are awesome. But the

1571
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:05,490
streaming per minute payments,
that's where the lifeblood of

1572
01:38:05,490 --> 01:38:08,580
the future lightening value for
value economy comes from,

1573
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:13,920
because that is how people I
forget to boost it. And I'm

1574
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:17,700
listening to the show. But I
always know that that 100 SATs

1575
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:20,310
minute that I selected, that's
always going to be ping, ping,

1576
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:22,950
ping, ping ping, right. And I
don't have to, I don't have to

1577
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:27,120
remember in people, once a
minute you the podcasters

1578
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:30,420
looking at their dashboard is
Ping, ping ping to get income

1579
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:31,830
coming in. And then also it's

1580
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:38,130
Adam Curry: okay, that's a good
point. People who who want to

1581
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:42,060
integrate and this arrowhead is
not going to stop who thinks

1582
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:45,390
zapping is important, that's
great. But your your fucking

1583
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:48,750
everybody else because you can't
do splits. You're not going to

1584
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:51,420
do that no one's going to be
zapping nine different times and

1585
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:55,020
nine different values. So you're
circumventing the whole process.

1586
01:38:55,740 --> 01:39:01,200
And I would I would also
encourage other apps and

1587
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:04,860
services to consider that you're
really undermining it.

1588
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:07,710
Dave Jones: You're podcasting is
not social media. They're

1589
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:08,370
correct.

1590
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:12,060
Adam Curry: And I love zapping
as as a replacement for like I

1591
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:16,170
think that's a great idea. It's
fantastic to I mean, and that's

1592
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:20,580
where it's appropriate. Makes a
lot of and I liked it that it's

1593
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:24,810
getting people into the into the
habit of returning some value

1594
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:28,650
for something I like that a lot.
I really do. But stay in your

1595
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:31,860
lane, because it's an it's not a
we put a lot of work into the

1596
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:35,460
whole infrastructure. And you
know, when I hear the get Alby

1597
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:38,460
and everyone wants to do this, I
think they're riding a train and

1598
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:40,740
they're screwing themselves and
other people with it.

1599
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:48,870
Dave Jones: I agree to and I
think that I fully understand

1600
01:39:48,870 --> 01:39:55,380
what you're saying. I think
you're right. The zapping is a

1601
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:59,970
great mechanic for returning
value for a value for value ecos

1602
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,410
system in general, it makes
sense. The way that the way that

1603
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:07,740
noster it the social media
aspect of nostrils designed the

1604
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:11,940
zapping makes sense. That's Yes,
podcasting. They're not the

1605
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:14,760
same. keep them separate. This
just doesn't make sense for

1606
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:18,450
podcasting. We've, we've, we've
been through this we've done

1607
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:21,900
this is where two and a half
years into this noster is brand

1608
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:24,300
new. This is not the same thing.

1609
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:27,930
Adam Curry: Yeah, and the main
thing, and this is what I want

1610
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:34,320
to say to our head who's saying
no, it's the same as a boost.

1611
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:40,470
No, it's not. Because we have a
split flow is not the same as a

1612
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:46,560
boost. I'm just I, you know, as
a wallet provider get Alby makes

1613
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,750
total sense. They can do
whatever they want, you know,

1614
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:54,900
they want to do Aaron, what is
the what is the API payment

1615
01:40:54,900 --> 01:41:01,110
thing? Was LSAT? Yeah, they
there'll be many applications

1616
01:41:01,110 --> 01:41:06,870
for LSAT. Absolutely. Fountain,
questionable. So I'm just saying

1617
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:11,340
if you want to break the system
by by having people circumvent

1618
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:15,810
the splits. Have at it, but
you're going to lose out in the

1619
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:17,220
long run in the long run.

1620
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:22,470
Dave Jones: I think there's a
general issue here where this

1621
01:41:22,470 --> 01:41:26,040
has always been the word and I
just want to be, I want to step

1622
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:28,470
back and be gracious to
everybody for a minute. I think

1623
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:36,570
there is a a, there's always
been within this project. There

1624
01:41:36,570 --> 01:41:40,950
have been Bitcoiners coming to
podcasting and podcasting coming

1625
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:45,390
to Bitcoin. Yeah. And so the
those there's a natural sort of

1626
01:41:45,390 --> 01:41:52,500
missing a natural, a natural,
like a Venn diagram. And they

1627
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,450
overlap in the middle, but
there's a lot of places they

1628
01:41:54,450 --> 01:41:58,200
don't. So there's there's going
to be a natural tendency for one

1629
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:00,570
side to do things one way the
other side to do things the

1630
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:06,180
other way. And in podcasting 2.0
We have to make we have to be in

1631
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:09,450
the middle of that of that Venn
diagram and make those things

1632
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:13,020
mesh. Yeah, because the Bitcoin
people are gonna see things one

1633
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:14,940
way and be like, Yeah, let's do
that. To me, this is the

1634
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:21,390
fundamental mistake of of, of
forcing alien URL. Elon, you RLP

1635
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:25,440
down and down podcasting,
throat, it's not gonna work

1636
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,810
we've already thought this
through. So just

1637
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:31,890
Adam Curry: just know that we
have looked at we have looked at

1638
01:42:31,890 --> 01:42:34,200
it is not necessarily going to
be a great idea.

1639
01:42:34,830 --> 01:42:38,430
Dave Jones: Yeah, and podcasters
also have ideas that don't fit

1640
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:42,150
within the other side. So we
have to mediate that as well. So

1641
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:45,840
yeah, I think I think there's
just a bit especially the bit

1642
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:49,980
the Bitcoin people, because
there's money involved. And what

1643
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:52,080
you see it with these bounties
and that kind of thing, that

1644
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:56,610
they, they just want to run off
and do something and it's like

1645
01:42:56,610 --> 01:42:59,670
you guys, you mean you can't,
she's not the way it works. And

1646
01:42:59,670 --> 01:43:03,090
you got to slow down and get
some consensus here. And think

1647
01:43:03,090 --> 01:43:06,990
about, think about the the
industry and the audience that

1648
01:43:06,990 --> 01:43:09,450
you're trying to address with
the technology that you're

1649
01:43:09,450 --> 01:43:12,930
making. If you're, if you're
trying to address problems

1650
01:43:12,930 --> 01:43:17,250
within podcasting, or music, or
other types of things, you need

1651
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:20,970
to understand that industry
fully before you dive in and

1652
01:43:20,970 --> 01:43:24,240
start building something and
trying to propose a standard

1653
01:43:24,510 --> 01:43:27,090
standards aren't bad, but you
have to at least understand what

1654
01:43:27,090 --> 01:43:28,740
the audience needs before you
make it.

1655
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:33,150
Adam Curry: I guess now, I know
how Marco feels. Right? Because

1656
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:36,030
I really felt like people were
bullying. You know, it's like,

1657
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:42,420
Nah, man, this is the way to go.
This is the way it is right now.

1658
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:43,500
I don't think so.

1659
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,740
Dave Jones: Anyway, you know, I
know some people did that to

1660
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:49,800
Marco that I you know, we we
told the people early on to

1661
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:55,080
chill out and stop being that
way. You know, I don't think I

1662
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:57,960
think his problems over those
people not not with yes, no,

1663
01:43:57,990 --> 01:43:59,340
Adam Curry: no, no, no, I know
that. I know.

1664
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:03,690
Dave Jones: He made he made a
comment about standards. And you

1665
01:44:03,690 --> 01:44:04,110
know, we

1666
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:06,900
Adam Curry: do we have a
standard there's lots of

1667
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:07,500
there's,

1668
01:44:08,070 --> 01:44:09,960
Dave Jones: I think those are
gonna be the other thing I said

1669
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:15,030
we we we briefly entertained
calling things standards and

1670
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:15,300
made

1671
01:44:15,330 --> 01:44:18,330
Adam Curry: by requests from
from hosting companies, by the

1672
01:44:18,330 --> 01:44:21,660
way, it was a request to do
that. And I think we even tried

1673
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:24,150
to I certainly tried to pick
that up and it just died on the

1674
01:44:24,150 --> 01:44:27,060
vine. And And honestly, I'm
happy.

1675
01:44:28,890 --> 01:44:31,440
Dave Jones: Their specs, these
are these justifications and you

1676
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:34,380
can either do them or not, you
don't nobody's forcing anybody

1677
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:35,130
to do anything.

1678
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:38,070
Adam Curry: Yeah, exactly.
You're all podcasting. 2.0 It's

1679
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:41,880
just more podcasting is not
breaking anything. It's not

1680
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:44,910
changing anything. It's not
making a new standard. And we're

1681
01:44:44,910 --> 01:44:47,370
gonna we have some interesting
meeting scheduled with people

1682
01:44:47,370 --> 01:44:50,280
who are kind of into that I'm
not sure I would even be for

1683
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:53,760
calling it a standard or W three
C. You know, I love the way

1684
01:44:53,790 --> 01:44:58,140
everything works. Now. We're the
boss, and everyone else can

1685
01:44:58,140 --> 01:45:06,840
pounce like that. I like that
system I mean it's so far it's

1686
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:09,540
worked out really well it's been
a very open process and it's

1687
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:12,870
been fantastic you know and the
minute you bring you know like

1688
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:15,810
official structure into it I was
like oh that's gonna ruin it

1689
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:22,680
Dave Jones: you can Yeah, that's
right. Oh airhead says landing

1690
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:25,770
addresses are no longer only
Elon URL that's right because

1691
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:31,380
because we booked that system
initially to get key sand in

1692
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:33,840
there as well so that's right I
said I mean this this stuff has

1693
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:34,620
been thought through

1694
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:39,000
Adam Curry: Yeah. Anyway, let's
take a few people as we move

1695
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:47,850
towards a buck 45 here okay, we
got the SIR Spencer stuff we got

1696
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:55,440
blueberry 17,776 Big freedom
boost sending boost pilling

1697
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:59,040
karma. Tonight I will attempt
giving comedian Sam Tripoli the

1698
01:45:59,070 --> 01:46:02,640
PC 2.0 equivalent of telling

because a lot of requests there.

1742

boosts. I didn't try to get the

1744
01:48:57,390 --> 01:49:00,300

I'm just gonna stick and read

1745
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:03,000
the boost that I had prepared
for Friday's show. Yeah, that's

1746
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,550
probably good. Because I got
everybody else. Yeah. And then

Dave Jones: And he's preaching
the gospel. Like to the far

1780
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:01,980
flung reaches of the Earth. It

on his way to Thailand.

1819
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:26,820
Dave Jones: Wow. Yeah, this
world tour. Well, he

1820
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:30,150
Adam Curry: he was he intended
to retire to Thailand before he

1821
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:32,790
kind of came out of retirement
to do this beef initiative.

1822
01:53:32,910 --> 01:53:35,550
Because Thailand is interesting.
I'm not talking Bangkok.

1823
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:40,140
Although that is that is fun for
some things. But more like Shang

1824
01:53:40,140 --> 01:53:44,220
Mei Xiang. I've been to Thailand
in a documentary. They're really

1825
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:48,600
nice, really nice people. A very
just sweet population very

1826
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:53,040
giving very open. They love
their royal family, you know, so

1827
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:58,050
they're, they're very, they're
nationalists. Food is fantastic.

1828
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:06,240
It's cheap, cheap to live there.
It's, I understand you, the Thai

1829
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:07,830
culture is really wonderful.

1830
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:11,460
Dave Jones: I've got a friend of
a friend who lived in Thailand

1831
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:16,320
as a teacher for gosh, seven or
eight years. And every time he

1832
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:19,860
came back to the US, he was
like, Oh, my God, things are so

1833
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:24,000
expensive here. He said it was
very cheap there. Lady said you

1834
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,950
could you could have a big meal
with five of your buddies Jen.

1835
01:54:29,490 --> 01:54:32,910
You know, it would cost you as
much as like a meal for two here

1836
01:54:33,030 --> 01:54:35,640
Adam Curry: unless you go to the
no hands restaurant in Bangkok,

1837
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:40,440
which is a whole nother story.
Okay, you know what, you know

1838
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:44,940
what the no hands restaurant is
so so so the food is in a table

1839
01:54:44,940 --> 01:54:50,040
is kind of like it's a round
table. And there's to bench

1840
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:53,430
seats comfortable, you know,
pillows and everything. So you

1841
01:54:53,430 --> 01:54:59,340
and your friends sit near the
food and behind you will be your

1842
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:03,930
servant. Who then who then will
get your food prepared and feed

1843
01:55:03,930 --> 01:55:04,530
it to you?

1844
01:55:05,730 --> 01:55:06,540
Dave Jones: Whoa,

1845
01:55:06,570 --> 01:55:14,190
Adam Curry: typically naked. Oh,
it's that kind of it was a long

1846
01:55:14,190 --> 01:55:17,910
time ago. But it was a
documentary. Funny enough

1847
01:55:18,269 --> 01:55:20,459
Dave Jones: is it sounds like a
plot of a movie is what it

1848
01:55:20,459 --> 01:55:21,269
sounds like. Yeah,

1849
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:23,790
Adam Curry: yeah, that's when
you know well if you remember

1850
01:55:23,910 --> 01:55:27,360
faces of death they actually
don't remember that the monkey

1851
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,550
head sticking out and they chop

the last show was seriously deer
in the headlights discuss. What

1898
01:58:35,970 --> 01:58:36,600
did we say?

all he said is not only wrote

Dave Jones: now he says growth
in podcasting is flat as a

1902
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:51,090
pancake. And based on calls.
I've been having podcasting

1903
01:58:51,090 --> 01:58:54,150
companies are in trouble. That
said best time ever to be a

1904
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:56,970
podcaster as audience numbers
are growing amongst fewer shows,

1905
01:58:56,970 --> 01:58:58,020
but go podcasting?

1906
01:58:58,049 --> 01:59:03,209
Adam Curry: Yeah, I'm with you
on that. Okay, when he says mean

1907
01:59:03,209 --> 01:59:05,309
when he says flat? I mean,
that's the growth of the

1908
01:59:05,309 --> 01:59:06,479
companies I guess.

1909
01:59:07,049 --> 01:59:11,489
Dave Jones: I guess. I don't
know. Maybe he just means the

1910
01:59:11,489 --> 01:59:15,089
number of the number of new
shows outside of the free.

1911
01:59:16,110 --> 01:59:19,470
Adam Curry: Yeah, yeah, that's a
bit yeah. New customers for

1912
01:59:19,470 --> 01:59:23,610
podcast hosts. Yeah, yeah. I
mean, you're gonna have churn.

1913
01:59:23,610 --> 01:59:26,700
You're gonna have people leaving
you need to get new people in. I

1914
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:28,920
don't know. I always hear
Buzzsprout always has another

1916
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:38,340
Dave Jones: Yeah, it must. It
must be. If it's like yeah, I

1917
01:59:38,340 --> 01:59:41,190
guess they're tied together. I
mean, you're it's a beautiful

1918
01:59:41,190 --> 01:59:43,920
thing. Because you're, there's
that direct your customer,

1919
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:45,540
you're the growth of your
company is the growth of your

1920
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:49,230
customer. There's funny money in
between. Exactly. It's a very

1921
01:59:49,230 --> 01:59:52,620
natural thing. Thank you, Todd.
Appreciate it. I don't even

1922
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:54,720

Adam and Dave, I listened to

1935
02:00:26,490 --> 02:00:30,720
Dave Jones: Dignified, Dave and
abiding Adam. Building a medium

1936
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:33,780
that provides the environment
for humanity to coalesce around

1937
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:37,920
since making broadcasters is no
easy feat if you ever want to

1938
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:41,790

digital heavy lifting, kick back
